This is the description of an adapter to use most CS/A boards in a C64.
A lot of CS/A boards, including a video card, serial interfaces, floppy
controller and an SCSI card can be found on the 
<a href="../../csa/index.html">CS/A65</a> homepage.
Below is the schemactics for a <em>C64 SCSI card</em>, derived from this
adapter and the CS/A SCSI card.

<H2>Description</H2>
The interface itself is, in fact, pretty simple. 
It is a board that is plugged into the C64 expansion port. On the 
other side it provides a socket for a CS/A bus card.
Two things have to 
be considered for the schematics: 
<ul>
<li>The C64 Video chip releases the bus with rising Phi2. This is too late
for the 6522. Thus the rising edge of Phi2 must be delayed to the 
CS/A bus, to be sure. The CS/A bus is specified to run up to 
2 MHz, so there is no speed problem.
<li>The I/O area in the C64 is 256 byte only. To cover the whole
CS/A bus address space (1M memory and 4k I/O) additional address
lines have to be generated. This is taken care of with a VIA 6522
on the adapter. More in the <a href="c64csadesc.txt">description</a>.
