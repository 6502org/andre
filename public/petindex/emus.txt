   [1]Text version

   PET computers are increasingly hard to get. So there are emulators that
   allow to run PET prgrams on other hardware. This page describes the
   different emulators available.

   [2]VICE
          This is the VICE emulator, that not only emulates the PET, but also
          most other Commodore 8-bit machines (C64, VIC20, C128, CBM-II). In
          VICE almost all PET computers are emulated (SuperPET 6809 mode is not
          supported), together with the different IEEE488 disk drives. The VICE
          emulator runs on different platforms, notably the Windows and
          Linux/Unix platforms are supprted, but others as well.

   [3]PET Emulator for the C64 by Bob Fairbairn
          This is a different type of emulator - it runs on the C64, and
          emulates the hardware only as far as it is able to catch hardware
          accesses using BASIC POKE and PEEK commands.

   [4]CS/A65
          The CS/A65 computer is not a software emulator, but a hardware
          emulator. It provides a very highly compatible system. In fact it
          runs a patched 3032 ROM just fine. Only a few IEEE488 lines have been
          moved around, and the CRTC still needs to be set to 80 columns and
          not 40 to display 80 columns.
