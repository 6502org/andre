   [1]Text version

   NEW: Although this is a 1.0 release, it is still a work in progress. I have
   now updated the links sections, and esp. added the disk drive section. Also
   I have included links to (partially commented) ROM listings for the PET
   ROMs!

   This file is intended to be an index about the PET line of Commodore
   computers. It is compiled out of several resources found on the internet. As
   there are a number of sites about the Commodore PET computers, this site
   concentrates on the technical aspects of those machines. Therefore you will
   find hardware and (machine) programming information for the PET here.

   I started this collection when I was working on the [2]VICE PET emulator.
   The VICE emulator now emulates several PET machines from the 2001 to the
   8296, including the old disk drives from 2040 to 8250.

   I think all the information is accurate, although it is certainly not
   complete. Also I would like to find some images of the different PET cases.
   I am also looking for the differences of the ROM versions. If you find
   anything that you think is not accurate, please tell me about it!

   I hope you enjoy this document.
