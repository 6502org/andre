   [1]Text version

   Here follows a description of the 4 major board revisions used in the
   Commodore PET line of computers. Please note that each board number
   describes a range of different boards - but the differences within a number
   described here should be too small and too unimportant to mention.

   Special thanks goes to William M. Levak for some of the details, esp. the
   hint with the programmable 2316 select line, that made it a lot more
   understandable.

   #1: 2000 series, ca 1977/78, Max RAM - 8k, expansion board to 32k
          This is the first and oldest board. The size of the ROMs was 2k, and
          the video RAM was as fast as the main memory. This meant that when
          the CPU accessed the video RAM the screen would show garbage for each
          used clock cycle - video "snow". Also there was no CRTC (Cathode Ray
          Tube Controller, short video controller) on the board, but all timing
          is done with discrete logic. Therefore there are two things built
          into this board:

          + The video can be disabled, effectively blanking the video screen.
            The signal line used for that was PIA1 CA2. This line was also used
            for the (in the ROM unfinished) IEEE488 support.
          + The screen "VIDON" signal (a line generated when the electron beam
            is supposed to do the vertical retrace) is fed to PIA1 CB1. This
            signal is used to generate a system interrupt for each video frame
            - this is different (in later models only?) for european and
            american models. The software checks the same line on VIA PB5. Only
            if the beam is on retrace the kernal writes something on the screen
            - this avoids the "snow" when accessing the screen when the
            electron beam is active.

          The board does not have a piezo beeper for VIA shift register output
          to sound.

          This board actually came in two flavours, one with the
          Commodore-specific ROM chips of the 6540 type (#1a), and one with the
          standard 2316 2k ROMs (#1b). When you look at the #1b schematics you
          may notice that some pairs of ROM sockets have exactly the same
          wiring. Simply speaking, using "normal" ROMs one would expect both
          sockets to react at the same time. And also A11 is connected to the
          sockets, but should not be needed for a 2k ROM. But the used 2316
          have a chip select line at the place where the 2332 have the A11, and
          this line is programmable! So for one of the ROMs in such a pair the
          select line is low-active, selecting the lower half of the 4k, the
          other one gets it high-active for the upper part of the 4k. So you
          can even swap the two ROMs of such a pair. And when upgrading one can
          simply plug a 4k ROM in one of the sockets and leave the other one
          empty!

          The layout of the board is (from the petfaq, pictures courtesy Bo
          Zimmermann):

   #2: European 3000 and 9" 4000 series, ca 1979/80, Max RAM - 32k
          This board is a considerable upgrade to the first one. The ROM size
          is 4k for one chip now (Except for the $E*** ROM, which is 2k. A11 is
          connected to the additional select line of the 2k chips (programmed
          as low-active, see above) as compared to the 4k, so it is only
          selected in the lower half, i.e. $E000-$E7FF. Putting a 4k ROM here
          gives a bus conflict in the I/O area. However there is a jumper to
          put the I/O area from $E8** to $88**, and then it would be feasible
          to use a 4k ROM. It seems CBM was looking for a way to get more ROM
          area, but probably found that moving the I/O to another location
          would break too many programs). Also the video RAM is faster so that
          the video access is done during the first half of the Phi2 CPU clock,
          while the CPU accesses the memory during the second half. It does
          not, however, add a CRTC controller and the piezo beeper. The VIDON
          signal still remains the same, but the screen can no longer be
          blanked by the PIA1 CA2 line.

          From the layout of the I/O and expansion ports it can be seen that
          the board can be / has been used in the same cases as the older board
          - and this is the 9" case.

   #3: 4000/8000 series, ca 1981. Adds a CRTC video controller Max RAM - 32k
          This board finally adds a CRTC video controller and a piezo beeper
          for the VIA shift register output.

          One other thing is that it replaced the VIDON line to generate the
          system interrupt with the vertical sync signal of the CRTC. The CRTC
          is able to address 16k of memory. In the PET only 2k are used and A0
          is even generated by the 16 bit access to the video memory (The 80
          cols CRTC has characters per line still set to 40), so the CRTC uses
          only 10 address lines. The two uppermost CRTC address lines have now
          been used for control purposes: The MA13 line is an additional line
          to the character ROM, so that you can switch to another set of
          characters, if available. The MA12 line is used to invert the video
          output completely, i.e. then the electron beam is on even on the
          flyback (horizontal and vertical retrace). I assume this was to
          compensate for different video electronics.

          The ROM size is still 4k. Although the $E*** ROM is labeled 2316 (2k)
          in the schematics, A11 is still connected to the /CS line, and the
          pin is even described as A11 for the 2k chip :-) However, the other
          select line /SELE is now masked at $E8**, such that it is active even
          in $E900-$EFFF (as in older boards) but not $E8** -> I/O area size
          256 byte only! But you only recognize this in a machine with a 4k
          $E*** ROM, as, unlike ususally, the 2k ROM is not mirrored but leaves
          open addresses in $E900-$EFFF.

          This board actually came in different flavours:

          + #3a as an early design could only be used for the for 80** series,
            i.e. it could only display 80 chars a line. So the first 12" models
            were all 80** machines.
          + #3b is a later modification of the #3a board: This board could be
            modified for 40 columns and 80 columns video output! As such it has
            been sold in the 4000 series ("fat-40") and the 8000 series. There
            was an upgrade from 4000 to 8000 and it consisted of an additional
            2k video RAM and some jumper setting on the board to shift address
            lines (probably some resoldering of a few chips, see next board).
            As can be seen from the layout the board has been made for a
            different case, namely the 12" edgy (one-piece) case. This board
            even came in different flavours (with minor artwork differences),
            and the latter have been called Universal Dynamic PET board.

          On [2]the CBM archive there are schematics for the old 8032 (#3a) as
          well as two flavours of the universal dynamic board.

          The first 8032 board (#3a) introduced a little-known feature - the
          NOROM line. It was a connection from CPU pin 5 - that is unconnected
          in the 6502 - and the chip select lines for the ROMs. If you would
          pull this line low, the chips would ignore any read request. This
          allowed to build CPU adapters (to be put between the CPU and the
          board) that replaced the builtin ROM with other memory mappings! This
          is in fact used by the SuperPET expansion and probably also by the
          8096 64k expansion board.

          At the end of its production cycle it has also been used in the new
          separate keyboard cases, with turnable monitor. The problem was that
          it didn't fit into the casing so they had to provide extra wires to
          connect the board with the connector on the back. You can recognize
          this board by the real IEEE488 connector on the back, not the usual
          card edge connector.

          For this board an expansion board was available that increased the
          available memory by 64k to 96k RAM. With the expansion board this is
          the first PET to sport memory management by the possibility to remap
          the upper 32k. The upgraded model is known as 8096 and although the
          ROM is the same as the 8032 (Basic 4) there is a BASIC extension (LOS
          96) that uses this expansion memory (see also the [3]8x96 page).

          Also available for this board was the [4]SuperPET expansion board(s),
          to include a 6551 UART, 64k RAM (not compatible to the above
          extension) and a 6809 CPU with its own ROMs.

          AT least the SuperPET extension uses the /NOROM line the disables the
          ROM mapping. The SuperPET extension replaces the CPU with a special
          board, with only few other connections to the main board. This #3
          board has the /NOROM line connected to an unused CPU pin, to make it
          available to the SuperPET board.

          The layout is (from the petfaq):

   #4: 4000/8000 board with 128k RAM, when? , with CRTC video controller
          This board is a complete rebuild of the 8096, but using two banks of
          64k dynamic RAM each that can be memory mapped as in the 8096. The
          only difference is that now even the video controller uses normal CPU
          memory (in the 128k RAM) for screen output, and it can access up to
          8k for it! Therefore the region $8800-$9000 is also mapped with RAM.
          By setting jumpers on the board it is possible to remap some ROMs
          with the RAM underneath. See also the [5]8x96 documentation.

          This board can be set to 40 or 80 chars per line (by resoldering two
          chips), but is in fact a 8296, used in 12" separate keyboard machines
          (I have yet to see a report for a 40 column machine with this board).
          Also the I/O area is only one page ($E800-$E8FF), and the area from
          $E900 to $EFFF is now used as ROM for nationalized editors.

          The CRTC MA13 line is still used as additional character ROM address
          line, while MA12 is not connected anymore. Interestingly the RAM is
          accessed with 4 MHz, where during Phi2 low the video logic reads in
          two bytes to allow for 80 columns display, while during Phi2 high the
          CPU only does a single access.

          The board now fits into the "round-edge", or "separate keyboard" PET
          case, with the extra keyboard connector to the front.

          The layout is (from the petfaq):
