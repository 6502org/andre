<h1>CRTC test programs and internals</h1>
<p>
This is a collection of information for the CRTC 6545.
<p></p>
There is NO WARRANTY of any kind attached to the information contained
in this collection!!!
DO NOT RUN THE PROGRAMS FROM THIS COLLECTION ON YOUR COMPUTER!!!
<p></p>
This includes some test programs for a Commodore PET in the
<a href="pet/index.html">pet</a> directory.
The test programs use some timing effects to produce raster effects
on the screen. They run on my 8296, but not on yours. 
I only provide the source as a reference on how to do these
timing effects. 
<p></p>
The subdirectory <a href="internals/crtc.html">internals</a> contains a 
vague description of the CRTC
internals as derived from the results of the test programs.
It also summarizes the differences between the different CRTC models.
</p><p>
The "petindex" directory contains the CRTC description of the PET index.

Take care!
