The 8096 basically is an 8032 with a 64k expansion board.
Later Commodore redesigned the 8032 board to include the 64k
expansion board by using complete 128k of RAM! The 8296 were
sold in the slick separate keyboard cases, and the top models
had a 8250 disk drive builtin.

<H2>8x96 memory mapping</H2><P>
The 64k RAM of the 8096 can replace the upper 32k address range. 
The mapping is best depicted with this table
(from the 8296 supplement to the 8032 manual):

</PRE><P>
In the 8096 the left memory map is exactly the PET 8032 memory map.
(The 8296 is different, but for this see below).
The mapping is controlled by a write-only register at $fff0:

Figure 2-2 depicts the functions of the memory control register.
The paragraphs following it describe these functions in detail.

        Expansion Memory
        Control Register

Control Register Bit 7 - When equal to 1, enables the expansion memory.
When bit 7 equal to 0, expansion memory is disabled. Bit 7 defaults to 0
on power up.

Control Register Bit 6 - When equal to 1, I/O peek through is enabled.

Control Register Bit 5 - When equal to 1, screen peek through is enabled.

Control Register Bit 4 - Reserved.

Control Register Bit 3 - When equal to 1, block 3 (16k-byte) is selected.
When equal to 0, block 2 (16k-byte) is selected.

Control Register Bit 2 - When equal to 1, block 1 (16k-byte) is selected.
When equal to 0, block 0 (16k-byte) is selected.

Control Register Bit 1 - When equal to 1, addresses $C000 through $FFFF
on the /Expansion Memory Board only/ are write protected.
I/O is not write protected if I/O peek through is enabled.
When equal to 0, the addresses are not write protected.

Control Register Bit 0 - When equal to 1, addresses $8000 through $BFFF
on the /Expansion Memory Board only/ are write protected.
The screen is not write protected if screen peek through is enabled.
When equal to 0, the addresses are not write protected.

<H2>8296 Information</H2>
<P>
The 8296 is a complete redesign of the PET universal board.
It fits into the separate keyboard case, and directly holds 
128k RAM, of which 96k can be used as in the 8096. In addition,
using "user jumpers" on the motherboard, the ROM can be 
completely switched off to access the RAM "under the ROM",
so that the complete 128k RAM are accessible. The "user jumpers"
could be set to connect to the userport, so this could even be done
under program control.
</P><P>
For the other features of the 8296, please have a look at the 
<A HREF="orig/8296supplement.html">8296 supplement</A>
to the 8032 manual.
</P><P>
The 8296 uses three PLAs to reduce the number of logic chips considerably.
The PLAs have been read out and the equations have been reverse engineered.
You can find the description in <A HREF="local/8296desc.txt">8296desc.txt</A> and the images and equations in <A HREF="local/8296desc3.tar.gz">8296desc3.tar.gz</A>.

<P>More info can also be found in the <A HREF="http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/firmware/computers/pet/8296/index.html">8296 firmware page</A> on the CBM archive.</P>
<H2>Orignal Docs and LOS-96</H2>
<P>There are some original documents available in electronic form
(of course always looking for more):
</P><P><UL>
<LI>CBM <A HREF="orig/8296supplement.html">8296 Supplement</A> to the 8032 manuals
<P></LI><LI>CBM released a LOS-96 (Loadable Operating System for the 8x96) that
actually is an improved basic. There is some german documentation in
<A HREF="orig/Los96-de.html">Los96-de.html</A> and <A HREF="orig/LosKit-de.html">LosKit-de.html</A>.
The LOS-96 software can be found in <A HREF="soft/los96-disk.tar.gz">los96-disk.tar.gz</A>
which is the same as on funet, but includes a VICE PET emulator .x64 disk
image with the stuff.
