Peripherals

   This section contains projects related to PET peripherals, mostly IEEE488
   related.

   [2]CBM-HD
          Ruud Baltissen has made a project to emulate Commodore IEEE488 disk
          drives using a PC and some hardware.

   [3]LPTIEC and other IEEE488 stuff
          As I have used the IEEE488 bus to connect (almost) all my Commodore
          equipment, even with my Atari ST and later the PC (as harddrive) I
          have created a page for it. It contains an IEEE488 interface for the
          PC to emulate IEEE488 disk drives (using VICE drive code :-), a
          System to have the PET access serial IEC disk drives, and IEEE488
          interfaces for the C64, VIC20 and the VC1541.

   [4]The transfer section of the CBM archive
          Contains a lot of transfer utilities to copy files from the PC to the
          PET and back.

   [5]Flash Attack cable and sound
          This page contains the description of the "Flash Attack" cable, as
          well as a PET sound interface. See also [6]here.

   The [7]PET library and [8]olcomputers.net have circuits for composite video
          output.
          One of the deficiencies of the PET is that it has no composite video
          output to connect normal monitors to it. These links show two
          circuits (PET library from "THE PET REVEALED" by Nick Hampshire,
          p117f, 1979, whereas oldcomputers.net claims their circuit is
          untested). Another sample circuit (well, some resitors basically...)
          for a 6545 CRTC can be found in my [9]CS/A65 computer.

System Projects

   This section contains projects that relate more to the PET itself

   [10]CS/A65
          This computer system is a modular system with an MMU and other nice
          features. One feature is the 95% PET compatibility. It actually runs
          a 3032 PET emulator - which is a slightly patched up copy of the PET
          ROM (the only difference is the CRTC uses real columns even in 80 col
          mode, and some IEEE488 lines are swapped around). I plan on building
          an adapter to use the CS/A65 I/O cards in a PET computer.

   [11]PET RAM - a universal 6502 RAM/ROM expansion
          This is a universal PET RAM/Flash ROM expansion with schematics and
          board diagrams in Eagle(tm) format.

   [12]PET-REU
          This is a RAM expansion unit for the PET, using the (in old boards)
          unused $8800-$8fff memory area.

Misc links

   This section contains other 6502-related links, that are less PET-related.

   Note: schematics and chip data are linked from the [13]links page

     * [14]6502.org with a host of 6502-related stuff and original host of the
       PET index.
     * [15]Ruud Baltissen not only has the CBM-HD, but other Commodore hardware
       and software projects as well.
     * [16]cbmhardware.de has some german info.
