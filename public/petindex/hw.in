<H2>Peripherals</H2>
<P>This section contains projects related to PET peripherals, mostly IEEE488 related.</P>
<P><DL>
<DT><A HREF="http://www.baltissen.org/htm/cbmhd.htm">CBM-HD</A></DT>
<DD>Ruud Baltissen has made a project to emulate Commodore IEEE488 disk drives
using a PC and some hardware.</DD>
<DT><A HREF="http://www.6502.org/users/andre/ieee488/">LPTIEC and other IEEE488 stuff</A></DT>
<DD>As I have used the IEEE488 bus to connect (almost) all my Commodore 
equipment, even with my Atari ST and later the PC (as harddrive) 
I have created a page for it. It contains an IEEE488 interface for the PC
to emulate IEEE488 disk drives (using VICE drive code :-),
a System to have the PET access serial IEC disk drives, and IEEE488 
interfaces for the C64, VIC20 and the VC1541.
</DD>
<DT><A HREF="@CBMARC@/crossplatform/transfer/">The transfer section</A> of the CBM archive</DT><DD>Contains a lot of transfer utilities to copy files from the PC to the PET and back.</DD>
<DT><A HREF="http://www.portcommodore.com/flashcable.php?path=main-lproj">Flash Attack cable and sound</A></DT>
<DD>This page contains the description of the "Flash Attack" cable, as well as a PET sound interface. See also <A HREF="http://www.portcommodore.com/flashfiles.php?path=main-cbmidx-flashidx">here</A>.</DD>
<DT>The <A HREF="http://members.tripod.com/~petlibrary/COMPVID.HTM">PET library</A> and <A HREF="http://oldcomputers.net/pet2001.html">olcomputers.net</A> have circuits for composite video output.</DT>
<DD>One of the deficiencies of the PET is that it has no composite video
output to connect normal monitors to it. These links show two circuits
(PET library from "THE PET REVEALED" by Nick Hampshire, p117f, 1979, whereas
oldcomputers.net claims their circuit is untested). Another sample
circuit (well, some resitors basically...) for a 6545 CRTC can be found in my <A HREF="http://www.6502.org/users/andre/csa/">CS/A65</A> computer.

<H2>System Projects</H2>
<P>This section contains projects that relate more to the PET itself</P>
<P><DL>
<DT><A HREF="http://www.6502.org/users/andre/csa/">CS/A65</A></DT>
<DD>This computer system is a modular system with an MMU and other nice 
features. One feature is the 95% PET compatibility. It actually runs
a 3032 PET emulator - which is a slightly patched up copy of the PET ROM
(the only difference is the CRTC uses real columns even in 80 col mode, and
some IEEE488 lines are swapped around). I plan on building an 
adapter to use the CS/A65 I/O cards in a PET computer.
</DD>
<DT><A HREF="http://www.6502.org/users/andre/cbmhw/ryofat40/index.html">Build your own Fat40</A></DT>
<DD>This project consists of three specific boards for the <a href="http://www.6502.org/users/andre/csa/index.html">CS/A65</a> computer that together
can make up a PET 4032.
</DD>
<DT><A HREF="http://people.freenet.de/x1541/hardware/petram.html">PET RAM</A> - a universal 6502 RAM/ROM expansion</DT>
<DD>This is a universal PET RAM/Flash ROM expansion with schematics and board diagrams in Eagle(tm) format.</DD>
<DT><A HREF="http://www.cbmhardware.de/cbmpet/petcart.php">PET-REU</A></DT>
<DD>This is a RAM expansion unit for the PET, using the (in old boards) unused
$8800-$8fff memory area.
</DD>

<H2>Misc links</H2>
<P>This section contains other 6502-related links, that are less PET-related.</P>
