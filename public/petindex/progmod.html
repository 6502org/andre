<H1>PET index - programming model</H1><P><A HREF="progmod.txt">Text version</A>
<P>Here you can find information you need to program the PET computer.
</P>
<H2>Memory Map</H2>
<P>The memory map of the PET is pretty simple - if you do not consider
the 8096 and 8296 models. We will therefore only discuss the models up
to 8032 and the other two later.
</P>
<P><DL>
<DT>$0000-$0FFF ... $7FFF</DT>
<DD>RAM of different size. Models were shipped with 4k to 32k.</DD>
<DT>$8000-$8FFF</DT>
<DD>Screen memory. Board #1 and #2 have 1k of screen RAM, mirrored 4 times.
Board #3 has (1k for 40 cols or??) 2k of RAM, mirrored 2 times.
The CRTC address range is limited to the screen RAM.
Board #4 uses normal CPU memory for the screen, i.e. the screen memory size
is 4k. The CRTC on board #4 can address 8k, however.</DD>
<DT>$9000-$9FFF</DT>
<DD>This is an expansion ROM area. Some programs need a kind of dongle-ROM
for copy protection in this socket. This was annoying when different
programs needed different ROMs in the same socket...</DD>
<DT>$A000-$AFFF</DT>
<DD>This is an expansion ROM area. See above ($9000)</DD>
<DT>$B000-$BFFF</DT>
<DD>For the original ROMs and the upgrade ROMs that start at $C000,
this is an expansion ROM area. See above ($9000). For the 4.0 ROMs, 
this is the first part.</DD>
<DT>$C000-$DFFF</DT>
<DD>BASIC ROMs (two with 4k each)</DD>
<DT>$E000-$E7FF</DT>
<DD>Editor ROM (in 4.0 ROMs, normal system ROM area otherwise)</DD>
<DT>$E800-$EFFF</DT>
<DD>I/O area (PETs without CRTC), see below. For PETs with CRTC (Fat-40 and
8032) the I/O area is 256 byte ($E800-$E8FF) and the rest is either
open address or the $E*** ROM iff it is 4k.</DD>
<DT>$F000-$FFFF</DT>
<DD>Kernel ROM</DD>
</DL>

<H2>I/O Area</H2>
<P>The I/O area in general is 2k from $E800 to $EFFF. Used, however, is
only one page ($E800-$E8FF). In the board #4 the I/O size has been reduced
to this page, allowing for more ROM space in $E900-$EFFF for nationalized
keyboard mappings.
</P><P>
The decoding has been done with minimal effort: The address lines 
A4-A7 are each directly used to select an I/O chip. Bit A4 must be set 
for the PIA&nbsp;1, A5 must be set for PIA&nbsp;2, A6 must be set for
the VIA and A7 must be set for the CRCT (if available). This results
in some addresses where more than one chip is selected. When reading
them, all selected chips drive the data bus. As these chips have NMOS
drivers, they should produce a wired-and of all chip outputs, but
this is not always the case and may depend on other bus loads or whatever.
Below only the normal mappings are described. For the exact description
see the <A HREF="links.html#petio">petio</A> file.
</P><P>
<DL>
<DT>$E810-$E81F - <A HREF="links.html#chipdata">PIA</A>&nbsp;1</DT>
<DD>
PIA 1 is used for the keyboard, some tape I/O and the IEEE488
EOI line. Also CB1 is used to generate the system interrupt - it is 
connected to the screen vertical blank signal and can generate IRQs
on level transitions.
</DD>
<DT>$E820-$E82F - <A HREF="links.html#chipdata">PIA</A>&nbsp;2</DT>
<DD>
PIA 2 has the 8 IEEE488 data lines (in and out) and some IEEE488 control lines.
</DD>
<DT>$E840-$E84F - <A HREF="links.html#via">VIA</A></DT>
<DD>
The VIA is used for the Userport, Tape and some IEEE488 control lines. CA2 
switches the character ROM between graphics and text mode. 
The original ROM PET 2001 in the text mode has upper and lower characters
exchanged. CB2 (which is the shift register output) is connected to
the speaker on newer PETs. Changing the shift register contents and bit rate
modulates the tune of the sound.
</DD>
<DT>$E880-$E88F - (<A HREF="links.html#chipdata">CRTC</A> and <A HREF="crtc.html">CRTC operation</A>)</DT>
<DD>
The CRTC is only available in newer PETs, with the boards #3 and #4.
It has only two registers, one to write the internal register number to
and one for the internal register value. In the following only the internal
register numbers will be used.
<P>
The 6545 is a very flexible chip. It can be programmed very freely to 
different video timings. In fact it has been used in early PC video cards
and VGA cards still have an emulation of the 6545 registers.
For a complete description please have a look at the <A HREF="links.html#chipdata">CRTC docs</A> or a description on the <A HREF="crtc.html">CRTC operations</A>.
I will now only go into the PET specifics, that I read from the 
<A HREF="links.html#schematics">schematics</A>.
</P><P>
The 6545 has 14 address lines (VA), allowing up to 16k of video memory to be
addressed. In the PET, however, not all of them are used. All PETs
with CRTC (except 8296) only use VA 0-9 the 1k video area. The 80 cols
PET also only use these addresses, as the they are here used as A1-A10.
Two bytes are read simultaneously from the two video RAM chips (1k each)
during each clock cycle, allowing for the higher character rate.
(I have not found out how the 8296 does that, because it uses normal CPU RAM
for the video output). So the 80 cols PET set their screen width to
40 in the CRTC too. As the character counting only counts up to 1k the 
upper bits of the screen address (that can be set in the CRTC) are
unchanged and used for control here (i.e. VA12 and VA13; VA10 and VA11 
are unused).
</P><P>
VA12 is used to invert the complete video signal after blanking the 
off-screen areas. Changing this signal would switch on the electron beam
during the retrace times, i.e. one would see the `flyback'.
</P><P>
VA13 is, probably more importantly used as another address line for the
character generator ROM. This is probably used for nationalized character
sets?
</P><P>
The screen memory is read with the addresses given from the CRTC. The value
read is then given to the character generator ROM as address and the output
is fed to the video shift register. Only seven bits from the memory are used
as character ROM addresses, the 8th bit is used to invert the character
by hardware!
</P><P>
One character normally consists of 8 scanlines and during each of the scan 
lines the CRTC provides the same address, only its RA&nbsp;0-4 count the
scan lines. RA 0-2 are given the the character generator ROM to display
a different byte for each scan line. On the CRTC PET the upper/lower
case mode sets the
number of scan lines to 9 (or 10?) though. But the hardware automatically
blanks the displayed character for all scan lines above the 8th...
</P>
</DD>
</DL>

<H3>8096 and 8296 models</H3>

<P>The 8032 with 64k expansion board - which is the same as the 8096 model
introduced memory mapping the upper 32k. Therefore a new write-only register
was created, at $FFF0. By writing certain values into it, two 16k areas
from $8000-$BFFF and $C000-$FFFF can be mapped to two different
expansion memory blocks each, giving up to 64k expansion RAM. 
The screen memory ($8000-$8FFF) and the I/O area ($E800-$EFFF) can 
be excepted from the mapping. Also the pages can be mapped read-only.
</P><P>
The memory mapping can be seen in this <A HREF="imgs/expmemmap.gif">image</A>.
</P><P>
As ROM the 8x96 models have the standard 8032 4.0 ROMs. Only they can
run the LOS-96 operating system, an improved BASIC version.
</P><P>
The description of the $FFF0 register is included in the 8096 addendum
in the <A HREF="links.html#petio">petio</A> text.
</P>

<H3>8296 models</H3>
<P>
The 8296 includes the 8096 memory mapping in its own hardware already.
Its RAM is organized in 2 banks of 64k, where the second bank is used
as expansion RAM. The lower half of the first bank is used as normal RAM, 
the second half is mapped write-only under the ROM. Only the screen 
memory ($8000-$8FFF) is mapped read/write. By setting certain jumpers
on the hardware the expansion ROM areas ($9000-$9FFF and $A000-$AFFF) 
can be switched off, mapping the RAM from the first bank there.
</P><P>
The CRTC in the 8296 uses the video address lines VA&nbsp;0-11, giving
8k of addressable (they are used as A1-A12 in 80 cols models!) video RAM.
Only VA&nbsp;12 is still used to switch the character ROM.
The lower 4k ($8000-$8FFF) are usable anyway, only the upper 4k 
($9000-$9FFF) can be used write-only without jumper settings or
read/write with a jumper set (see <A HREF="links.html#petio">petio</A> text.

                6-0 enable interrupts; same bits as in IFR.
E84F    PORTA       USER PORT without CA2 handshake

Note 1: E84F is the preferred user port register, since CA2 controls screen
graphics.

Note 2: The motor is on when this line is low, and off when it is high.

Note 3: CA1 is connected to pin B of the user port. Pins B-L correspond to
port A, which is invariably E84E. CB2 (connected to the shift register) also
connects to pin M of the user port; square wave tones (see chapter 9 of
"Programming the PET/CBM") use these facts. CB1 signals input from cassette
#2. CA2 controls screen graphics: it is configured for output, and, when
low, gives lower case characters and others. When high, the mode is upper
case and graphics.
