<DD>Ruud Baltissen has made a project to emulate Commodore IEEE488 disk drives

<DT><A class="extlink" HREF="http://www.6502.org/users/andre/ieee488/" target="_blank">LPTIEC and other IEEE488 stuff</A></DT>
<DD>As I have used the IEEE488 bus to connect (almost) all my Commodore
equipment, even with my Atari ST and later the PC (as harddrive)
I have created a page for it. It contains an IEEE488 interface for the PC
to emulate IEEE488 disk drives (using VICE drive code :-),
a System to have the PET access serial IEC disk drives, and IEEE488
interfaces for the C64, VIC20 and the VC1541.

<DD>This page contains the description of the "Flash Attack" cable, as well as a PET sound interface.</DD>

<DT>The <A class="extlink" target="_blank" HREF="http://members.tripod.com/~petlibrary/COMPVID.HTM">PET library</A>, <A class="extlink" target="_blank" HREF="http://oldcomputers.net/pet2001.html">olcomputers.net</A>, and <a class="extlinK" target="_blank" href="http://www.dasarodesigns.com/product/commodore-pet-video-mixer/">d'asaro designs (formerly known as 6540rom.com)</a> have circuits for composite video output.</DT>
<DD>One of the deficiencies of the PET is that it has no composite video
output to connect normal monitors to it. These links show two circuits
(PET library from "THE PET REVEALED" by Nick Hampshire, p117f, 1979, whereas
oldcomputers.net claims their circuit is untested). Another sample
circuit (well, some resitors basically...) for a 6545 CRTC can be found in my <A class="extlink" HREF="http://www.6502.org/users/andre/csa/">CS/A65</A> computer.
I have now updated the <a href="http://www.6502.org/users/andre/csa/vdc/index.html">VDC page</a> to include schematics and boards for adapted versions of the abovementioned two composite video circuits to work with my CS/A computer (which comes close to the PET in this respect).
<br/>
Herv&eacute; from the cbm-hackers list tells how to get video output on a VGA adapter:
<br/>
&quot;Simply take the schematics from 6540rom.com [ed: now d'asaro designs] and omit all resistors/capacitors that are 100% unneeded in this purpose (directly connect pin 6 of the 74LS02 to the PET's video connector). Take the [VGA] color signal at pin 10 of the 74LS02 and synchro from pin 4. You can add a decoupling capacitor between pins 7 &amp; 14 of the 74LS02 but that is [] not necessary.&quot;

    <subsection toc="colourpet" name="Colour PET">
        <desc><p>Steve Gray has announced this brand new project: add colour to your PET!
		It takes an interesting approach - it converts an 80 column PET back into a 40 column one
		and uses the extra byte fetched to achieve 80 columns as colour information instead!
		What's much more astounding is that it only takes <em>two</em> extra chips!
		The pictures on the link below show that the timing still needs to be improved though
		(as of May 2013) - the colour does not change exactly on the character borders.
		But I am confident that this will be fixed.

    <subsection toc="charram" name="Character generator RAM">
        <desc><p>Nils Eilers has managed to replace the - normally fixed - character ROM of the PET with a
                dual-port RAM card! It is written by mapping the character generator into a PET extension ROM
                area (switchable). With this you can dynamically change the character set displayed on the screen!
                Great work!

    <subsection toc="multiedit" name="40/80 column switcher and Multi-Editor ROM board">
        <desc><p>
		The Editor ROM is one of the few ROMs that actually change between (some) PETs besides the standard BASIC versions,
		as it has to support keyboard mapping, different screen timings for different screens, and so on.
		So for example there is a BASIC 4 editor that still supports the 9" screens without CRTC, to provide an upgrade path.
		And also we have Steve's Colour PET project from above! So the natural next step for Steve was to
		create a board to switch editor ROMs easily - see the link for more detail!
	</p><p>
		Steve has also built a 40/80 column switcher board, that is available separately or combined with the
		multi-editor board.

<DT><A HREF="http://www.6502.org/users/andre/csa/">CS/A65</A></DT>
<DD>This computer system is a modular system with an MMU and other nice
features. One feature is the 95% PET compatibility. It actually runs
a 3032 PET emulator - which is a slightly patched up copy of the PET ROM
(the only difference is the CRTC uses real columns even in 80 col mode, and
some IEEE488 lines are swapped around). I plan on building an
adapter to use the CS/A65 I/O cards in a PET computer.
