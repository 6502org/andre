   files from the PC to the PET and from the PET to the PC.

Transfer projects

   This section contains projects for file transfer.

   [2]C2N232
          From the website: C2N232 is a Commodore C2N cassette drive
          (datassette) emulator with an RS-232 interface. It was designed by
          Marko MÃ¤kelÃ¤ (http://www.funet.fi/~msmakela/). The device allows
          data transfers between all 8-bit Commodore computers that are
          equipped with a cassette interface (PET series, VIC-20, C64, C128,
          264 series, PET-II series) and any computer that has a 38400 bps
          RS-232 interface. Supported protocols include pulse width modulation
          (normal cassette LOAD/SAVE/OPEN, and any tape speeders that use at
          most 3 different pulse widths), and a custom protocol whose transfer
          speed exceeds 38400 bps already on a 1 MHz Commodore. The software is
          work in progress. The preferred methods of using the C2N232 are
          c2nload and cbmlink, the replacement of prlink.

   [3]cbmlink
          In the same location there is cbmlink. Whereas C2N232 uses a
          microcontroller, cbmlink also works with a lot of different types of
          cables between the PET and the PC. You find a list of supported
          cables in the documentation.

   [4]lptiec
          Lptiec is a small (hardware) interface to the PC printer port. It
          allows the PC to emulate an IEEE488 device, so that you can use the
          PC as a harddisk for the PET. The PC software runs on Linux.

   [5]par2ser
          This is an experimental system that transforms the parallel IEEE488
          into Commodore serial IEC. I.e. with this system the PET can use
          normal serial bus floppy disks like the VC1541 and company.

   [6]CBM-HD
          In this project by Ruud Baltissen the PC can be used "to simulate
          various IEEE drives". It uses a cable from the printerport, with only
          a little additional logic. The PC software runs under DOS/WIN98-DOS.
