   [1]Text version

   This part is under construction

   The Commodore disk drives for the PET computers actually are more
   intelligent than the PET itself - they had two 650x processors, one for the
   DOS and one for the drive controller. Using this "intelligent" design the
   PET was able to send a command to the disk drive and continue its own work,
   while the floppy was doing its.

   Disk drives to be used with the PET have to be equipped with an IEEE488
   interface. Most of the devices had two drives, but there are single drive
   units.

   In the following you find some more information about these drives:

     * [2]Disk drive list
     * [3]Architecture overview on the drives and schematics
     * [4]DOS ROM information
     * [5]Drive utility programs
     * [6]Gallery with pictures of the drives
     * [7]Drive capacity and compatibility and other DOS information.
     * [8]Disk error codes

Drive capacity and compatibility

   All in all, there were two major 5.25" disk formats for the PET series, the
   35 track double density version with around 170 kByte and the 39/78 track
   quad density version with 512k/1M Byte free. Both major types are completely
   incompatible.

   The quad density came in two variations only, single sided (8050 DOS2.5/2.7)
   and double sided (8250/1001 DOS2.7). The double sided drives could read the
   single sided disks ok. The single sided drives could even read the double
   sided disks, as long as the second side was not used.

   The double density disks are another story. With DOS1 Commodore introduced a
   disk format that is almost the same as in the 1541 - only in one of the
   speed zones there was one sector more. Therefore the disks had 670 blocks
   free. Probably Commdore found that there were too many errors, so with DOS2
   they reduced the number of blocks by one sector per track in one speed zone,
   resulting in 664 blocks free. But that is not the end of the story. In the
   disk format there is a write gap between the header and the data block.
   Commodore changed the size of the write gap from the DOS2 disks to the 1541.
   Due to this the drives are only read compatible. You can read more about
   this [10]here.

Disk drive error codes

   The Commodore disk drives indicated hardware failures detected during boot
   with a blink code. Here's the meaning from the 8050/8250 service manual:

  POWER UP DIAGNOSTIC FOR 8050/8250 FLASH CODE

   On power up, the three LED's on the drive should blink. The drive LED's go
   off and the center Tri-State LED remains green. The sytem has a built in
   self diagnostic which can be read in the form of a flash code. In the event
   of a failure, the 3 LED's will blink in a repetitive sequence. The number of
   blinks between intervals will indicate the possible location of a failure.

                       ERROR INDICATIONS
   NUMBER OF FLASHES       ERROR CAUSE      COMPONENT LOCATION
   1                 Zero Page              6532      UC1,UE1
   2                 ROM $E000-$EFFF        2364      UL1
   3                 ROM $C000-$DFFF        2364      UH1
   4                 Unused
   5                 Zero Page              6530 6502 UK3 UH3
   6                 Common RAM $1000-$13FF 2114      UC4,UC5
   7                 Common RAM $2000-$23FF 2114      UD4,UD5
   8                 Common RAM $3000-$33FF 2114      UE4,UE5
   9                 Common RAM $4000-$43FF 2114      UF4,UF5
   10                Controller ROM         6530 6502 UK3 UH3

   If the LED's come on and stay on, the microprocessor UN1 is probably at
   fault.
