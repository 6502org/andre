   [1]Text version

   There a a great variety of 5.25" disk drives. For the first PET with BASIC 2
   it started with the 2040 disk drive and with its CBM DOS 1.0. The design of
   this drive is typical for all the other dual drive disks up to the 8250, and
   even for the single drive 1001.

   Those drives have two 6502 processors (i.e. one 6502 and one 6504). The
   first processor (the 6504) connects to the drives and does all the disk
   read/write operations. It uses a hardware(!) GCR decoder to convert the data
   bytes to the GCR encoding that is used on the disk (for more details, see
   the [2]Architecture overview). The second processor (the 6502) does the
   IEEE488 transfer to the PET and all the file and directory handling. Both
   CPUs have their separate ROM, and some separate RAM. They communicate via a
   4k common RAM area. The DOS part - the 6502 ROM - was the same for a product
   line. The FDC part - the 6504 ROM - however can be different for different
   drive mechanics.

   The 2040 is a dual drive floppy disk. Its DOS 1.0 has a disk format that is
   very similar to the 1541 disk format. Only in one of the speed zones the
   format has one additional sector (resulting in 670 blocks free after
   format). The DOS lacked the relative files, though. It is assumed that the
   3040 only is a renaming of the 2040, to accompany the 30xx PET models. It
   has DOS 1.2, that was also shipped in later 2040 drives.

   The 4040 then got DOS 2.0. It features the same format as the 1541 (664
   blocks free) and relative files. Later it then got DOS 2.1. These drives
   were the first to sport relative files.

   DOS 2.5 then came with the 8050 drives and DOS 2.7 came with the 8250
   drives. Those drives feature 500k on one single-sided disk (8050) or 1M on a
   double-sided disk (8250)! The new DOS was needed to handle the 77 (8050)
   resp 154 (8250) tracks resp. The internal structure is still the same as the
   2040, with its 2 processors etc.

   DOS 2.7 is even capable of being used in the 4040, the 8050 and 8250 without
   changes. The DOS ROM checks the FDC for the type of drive (170k, 500k or 1M)
   connected and adjusts its tables appropriately. However, besides some 4040
   prototypes this DOS is only seen in 8050 and 8250 drives.

   The SFD1001 is a single drive disk drive. Basically it is a single-drive
   8250. In fact it uses the same ROM. Only the FDC always returns an error for
   the second drive.

   The 2031 seems to be a single drive 4040, yet it is not. It is in fact the
   sister drive of the 1541. As such it has only one CPU and the two ROM parts
   (DOS and FDC) have been put together into one. The FDC code has been put
   into the interrupt routine, while the DOS ROM is the main loop. Also the
   hardware GCR encode has been removed, so software GCR encoding and decoding
   routines have been added. The DOS version here is 2.6. The early 1540/1541
   manual says that DOS 2.6 is read/write compatible with the 4040 DOS.
   However, rumors have it that the write gap between header and block is
   different between the two, so that they are only read compatible ([3]Read
   more).

   Here is a list of disk drives for the Commodore PET

   Commodore IEEE-488 5.25" models
   2040 DOS1.0/DOS1.2 DOS1.0 contained bugs, most have been updated to DOS1.2,
   later models shipped with DOS1.2; 670 blocks free Many of these drives have
   later been updated to DOS2
   3040 DOS1.2 European 2040, like the 3000 series PET
   4040 DOS2.0/2.1 664 blocks free, read compatible with 1541
   4031/2031/2031LP DOS2.6 Single drive only. Read/Write compatible with
   1541/1571s. Basically a 1541 with an IEEE488 interface, i.e. one CPU only.
   8050 DOS2.5/2.7 Single Sided/Quad Density format, 512k per disk side. The
   DOS2.7 was the same for both, in fact even for the 1001, only the controller
   ROM differed.
   8250/8250LP DOS2.7<td<td> Double Sided/Quad Density format, 1mb per disk
   SFD-1001 DOS2.7 Same as 8250, but single drive unit. Other than the 2031 it
   still had both CPUs, and even the very same DOS as the 8250. Only the
   Controller DOS differed.

   The "LP" versions were "Low Profile" versions. Which means that while the
   other drives were delivered in the old "boat anchor" design with full height
   drives, the LP versions came in 1541-like (SFD-1001) design or even in a
   very slick low profile case for the 8250LP. You can see them in the [4]drive
   gallery.

   Commodore even sold 8" disk drives...

      Commodore IEEE-488 8" models
   8060 DOS1.x  750 kByte              (little info on this one...)
   8061 DOS1.x  1500 kByte?            (little info on this one...)
   8280 DOS3.x? 1 MB or 512k per Drive (little info on this one...)

   ... and harddisks for the PETs.

   Commodore IEEE-488 Hard Disk Drives
   9060 DOS? 5 MByte                    Hard Disk Unit
   9090 DOS? 7.5 MByte                  Hard Disk Unit

   Note: the DOS version numbering of "3.0" for harddisks and even later 8"
   drives seems inconsistent with the DOS 3.0 of the 1571 disk drive for the
   C64/C128.
