<BODY>
<H1>PET index - disks</H1><P><A HREF="drives.txt">Text version</A>
<P>There a a great variety of 5.25" disk drives. For the first PET
with BASIC&nbsp;2 it started with the 2040 disk drive and with
its CBM DOS 1.0.
The design of this drive is typical for all the other dual drive
disks up to the 8250, and even for the single drive 1001.
</P><P>
Those drives have two 6502 processors (i.e. one 6502 and one 6504).
The first processor (the 6504) connects to the drives and does
all the disk read/write operations. It uses a hardware(!) GCR
decoder to convert the data bytes to the GCR encoding that
is used on the disk (for more details, see the <A HREF="arch/index.html">Architecture overview</A>).
The second processor (the 6502) does the IEEE488 transfer to the
PET and all the file and directory handling.
Both CPUs have their separate ROM, and some separate RAM.
They communicate via a 4k common RAM area.
The DOS part - the 6502 ROM - was the same for a product line.
The FDC part - the 6504 ROM - however can be different for different
drive mechanics.
</P><P>
The 2040 is a dual drive floppy disk.
Its DOS 1.0 has a disk format that is very similar to the
1541 disk format. Only in one of the speed zones the format
has one additional sector (resulting in 670 blocks free after format).
The DOS lacked the relative files, though.
It is assumed that the 3040 only is a renaming of the 2040,
to accompany the 30xx PET models. It has DOS&nbsp;1.2, that was also shipped in later 2040 drives.
</P><P>
The 4040 then got DOS 2.0. It features the same format as the
1541 (664 blocks free) and relative files. Later it then got
DOS 2.1. These drives were the first to sport relative files.
</P><P>
DOS 2.5 then came with the 8050 drives and DOS 2.7 came with the 8250 drives.
Those drives feature 500k
on one single-sided disk (8050) or 1M on a double-sided disk (8250)!
The new DOS was needed to handle the
77 (8050) resp 154 (8250) tracks resp. The internal structure is still
the same as the 2040, with its 2 processors etc.
</P><P>
DOS 2.7 is even capable of being used in the 4040, the 8050 and 8250
without changes. The DOS ROM checks the FDC for the type of
drive (170k, 500k or 1M) connected and adjusts its tables appropriately.
However, besides some 4040 prototypes this DOS is only seen in
8050 and 8250 drives.
</P><P>
The SFD1001 is a single drive disk drive. Basically it is
a single-drive 8250. In fact it uses the same ROM. Only the
FDC always returns an error for the second drive.
</P><P>
The 2031 seems to be a single drive 4040, yet it is not.
It is in fact the sister drive of the 1541.
As such it has only one CPU and the two ROM parts (DOS and FDC)
have been put together into one.
The FDC code has been put into the interrupt routine, while the
DOS ROM is the main loop. Also the hardware GCR encode has been
removed, so software GCR encoding and decoding routines have been
added. The DOS version here is 2.6.
The early 1540/1541 manual says that DOS 2.6 is read/write compatible
with the 4040 DOS. However, rumors have it that the write gap between
header and block is different between the two, so that they
are only read compatible (<A HREF="writegap.html">Read more</A>).

<P>Here is a list of disk drives for the Commodore PET</P>

</TABLE>
<P>The "LP" versions were "Low Profile" versions. Which means that while the other drives were delivered in the old "boat anchor" design with full height drives, the LP versions came in 1541-like (SFD-1001) design or even in a very slick low profile case for the 8250LP. You can see them in the <A HREF="gallery/index.html">drive gallery</A>.

<P>Commodore even sold 8" disk drives...</P>

<P>Note: the DOS version numbering of "3.0" for harddisks and even later 8" drives seems inconsistent with the DOS&nbsp;3.0 of the 1571 disk drive for the C64/C128.
