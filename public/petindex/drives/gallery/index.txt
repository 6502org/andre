   image of a 3040 drive The 2040, 3040 and 4040 drives all looked like this
   The single-drive incarnation, the 4031 ... image of a 4031 drive
   image of a 2031 low profile drive ... and its low-profile brother
   The 8050 and 8205 drives don't look much different from the 4040 image of a
   8050 drive
   image of a 8250 low profile drive ... but the 8250LP certainly does!
   And this 1001 almost looks like 1541... image of a SFD1001 drive
   image of a 8280 drive The huge 8" disk drive 8280
   Commodore even sold harddrives for the PET, the 9060 and 9090 image of a
   9060 harddrive
