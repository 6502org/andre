  <section toc="roms" name="Read Disk Drive ROMs">
     <desc><P>These two programs read out the drive ROMs. There is one - simple - program
to read out the DOS ROM. It actually reads the upper 16k.
Another more complicated one is used to read out the FDC ROM. For this purpose it transfers some code into the drive buffer and lets it execute by the FDC
CPU with the $E0 opcode. The FDC CPU then copies its ROM into other drive buffers so that they can be read by the readout programm.</P>

	<desc><p>In the meantime I have received a comment on the program to read the FDC ROM. I cannot investigate it further,
		so I just put it here for reference.

@Andr√© : My "important" changes were at lines 20 to 23, to try to catch the lower 1k, may be did I messed up something ?
