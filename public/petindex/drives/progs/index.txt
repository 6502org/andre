   [1]Text version

   This page contains some small utilities for the Commodore disk drives.

Read drive ROMs

   These two programs read out the drive ROMs. There is one - simple - program
   to read out the DOS ROM. It actually reads the upper 16k. Another more
   complicated one is used to read out the FDC ROM. For this purpose it
   transfers some code into the drive buffer and lets it execute by the FDC CPU
   with the $E0 opcode. The FDC CPU then copies its ROM into other drive
   buffers so that they can be read by the readout programm.

   Program Binary Listing Comments
   Read FDC ROM [2]readfdc [3]readfdc.lst Read the FDC ROM from a dual
   processor drive. As after the reading the FDC CPU is stuck in an endless
   loop, the drive must be reset during execution.
   Read DOS ROM [4]readdos [5]readdos.lst Read the upper 16k of the DOS CPU
   address space from a dual processor drive. This includes the ROM image and
   is large enough for all dual CPU DOS versions.

Read disk images

   These programmes can be used to read disks into disk images and write the
   images back into disks. These files are linked from the [6]CBM archive
   (except for the listings).

   Program Binary Listing Comments
   Read image [7]dsk2file.prg [8]dsk2file.lst A BASIC/ML program to convert any
   CBM disk to a dump file (like VC1541 disk to .d64) for a PET or C64. The
   dump file should be written to a device larger than the dumped disk
   (although the program can be tailored to split an image).
   Write image [9]file2dsk.prg [10]file2dsk.lst A BASIC/ML program to restore
   any CBM disk from a fitting disk image (like .d64 restore to a VC1541).
   Read/Write disk image [11]emutil.prg [12]emutil.lst EMUTIL is a disk image
   archiver for the Commodore 64 and 16K+ CBM/PET computers. It supports all
   known Commodore disk drives, of all capacities. It also supports all CMD HD
   and RL Native partitions. Programmed by Bo Zimmerman and Andr√© Fachat.(See
   also [13]emutil.readme)
