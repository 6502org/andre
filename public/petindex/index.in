<H1>PET index</H1>
<!--P>Old: In the latest release I have updated SuperPET and 8x96 information, which mainly consists of photos. I have also updated the boards page with new board
images for the 8x96.</P>
<P>Old: Although this is a 1.0 release, it is still a work in progress. I have now updated the links sections, and esp. added the disk drive section. Also I have included links to (partially commented) ROM listings for the PET ROMs!</P-->
<P>This file is intended to be an index about the
PET line of Commodore computers. It is compiled out of several
resources found on the internet. As there are a number of sites
about the Commodore PET computers, this site concentrates on
the technical aspects of those machines. Therefore you will
find hardware and (machine) programming information for the 
PET here.
</P><P>
I started this collection when I was working on the
<A HREF="http://www.viceteam.org/index.html">VICE</A>
PET emulator. The VICE emulator now emulates several PET machines from the 2001
to the 8296, including the old disk drives from 2040 to 8250.
</P><P>
I think all the information is accurate, although it is certainly not
complete. Also I would like to find some images of the different PET
cases. I am also looking for the differences of the ROM versions.
If you find anything that you think is not accurate, please 
tell me about it!
</P><P>
I hope you enjoy this document.<BR>

<H2>What is covered and what not?</H2>
<P>Coverage is the whole line of Commodore PET computers, ranging
from the PET 2001 to the CBM 8296, as well as the SuperPET (aka MicroMainFrame 9000 in Europe). 
Not covered are the so-called "CBM-II" machines, the business machines CBM 610-620, 710-720 (also known as B128 and B256)
and the 510-520 (also known as P500)</P>
