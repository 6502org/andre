<h1>PET index - Killer Poke</h1><p class="copyright">(C)
1999-2020 André  Fachat</p> 
<div class="overview"><p>The so-called <EM>Fast Print</EM> or <EM>Killer Poke</EM> has much
been talked about.
<a target="_blank" class="extlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_poke">Wikipedia</a> states it nicely:
</p><p>
"The PET-specific killer poke is connected to the architecture of that machine's video rasterizer circuits. In early model PETs, writing a certain value to the memory address of a certain I/O register ( POKE 59458,62 ) made the machine able to display text on the screen much faster. When the PET range was revamped with updated hardware, it was quickly discovered that performing the old trick on the new hardware led to disastrous behavior by the new video chip, causing it to destroy the PET's integrated CRT monitor."
</p><p>
So what it is?
It is a Commodore BASIC Poke command that is supposed to be able to destroy
a PET computer. There have been claims that it is not possible to
destroy a PET by this poke.
Personally I never tried it on a possibly vulnerable PET
and I know of no confirmed death.
</p><p>
... so that was the beginning of the first version of this article I wrote a long time ago.
In April 2020, however, Tech Tangents has, together with Adrian from Adrian's digital basement, and 
some discussion on the vintage computer forum,
researched the killer poke even more. You can find the result of that research in 
<a target="_blank" class="extlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bMJ0NIuWU0">this youtube video</a>.
</p><p>
In this video, Tech Tangent shows the poke on an actually vulnerable PET, including scope
screen shots of some signals. It is definitely worth a look!
</p><p>
In this video we see that the "fast print poke" as it was known, is not the "killer poke" it
has often been named.
	</p>
<p>
Below I will go into the history, the technical details and the results from the current research.

<div class="rightimg"><a href="pet_snow.png"><img width="256px" src="pet_snow_small.png" /></a></div>
The very first PET models (board #1) had very slow video RAM.
Its access rate was the same as the rate of the main memory, 1 MHz.
Therefore only the CPU or the video logic could access the video
RAM at any one cycle, but not both.
To achieve proper operation, the CPU always has priority over the
video circuitry. When the video logic wants to read byte of video data
when the CPU accesses the video RAM, it reads invalid data. This
results in "snow" on the screen.
</p>
<h3><a name="blank" id="blank">Screen blank</a></h3> <p>
To overcome the problem, Commdore did two things. First they used a special
output line (CA2 of PIA1 at $E810 (59408)) that disabled the video
output. It was also used as EOI output to the IEEE488 bus.
On those PET models the screen blanked for a short period when the
IEEE488 interface was used.
Blanking the video with this line allowed to update the screen
quickly, without provoking snow on the display.
This feature was used by the kernal for scrolling, and by
a few games to do some explosion effects.
</p><p>
You can see the blinking when the kernel switches off video during 
scrolling when Adrian shows a test program running on an old PET
in the linked video (at around 9:00).
</p><p>
This feature has been removed in later models, and has nothing to do with the
killer poke. In those later models this output only controls the
IEEE488 EOI line.
</p><p>
According to Jim Butterfield's quote
`"..screen snow and 'scroll-up flash' has been
eliminated thanks to dynamic screen RAMs.." (quote by Jim
Russo, The Transactor, May 1979)` it has been removed
together with the introduction of
the board#2 models. In those models the screen RAM is faster and
allows 2 MHz access, video at Phi1 and CPU at Phi2.
</p>
<h3><a name="retrace" id="retrace">Wait for retrace</a></h3> <p>
The second feature was the vertical retrace input at VIA Port B ($e840, 59456),
bit 5. In the kernal's print routine there is a loop that waits for
this input to become low.
Thus the video memory is only used by the CPU in the off-screen
area. Of course it takes a lot of time to wait for the vertical retrace
when the electron beam is at the beginning of the screen.
</p><p>
This is where the fast print poke comes in.
The poke sets the VIA PB5 to low output. This way the kernal always thinks
the electron beam is at the retrace (it always reads the output register
value on port B for output pins, not the pin voltage level),
and immediately prints to the
screen. This is faster, but produces snow on the screen on the old PETs.
The vertical retrace signal is generated by the video logic, that is
discrete TTL in the old models (without the CRTC chip). It is also
used as an interrupt input to generate the system interrupt (CB1, PIA1).
</p><p>
When the poke is used, it sets two signal outputs to compete with each other:
the VIA PB5 output, and the 74LS08 that produces the "VIDEO ON" signal
used to check whether the screen is currently being drawn. Obviously 
in most cases the 74LS08 chip won - because otherwise there would not be 
any system interrupt on PIA's CB1 input pin caused by a changing signal.
</p><p>
However, as can be seen in the linked video, there may be cases where the
74LS08 is too "weak" to hold against the 6522. In such a case no video 
interrupt would happen anymore, and the screen would just keep blank 
(as VIDEO ON also controls the video output).
</p>
<h3><a name="crtc" id="crtc">CRTC using VSYNC</a></h3> <p>
When the board #3 was released the introduction of the CRTC video
chip changed the situation radically. Here the
CRTC produces the VSync signal, that is active only at a part of the
retrace. As there was no VIDEO ON signal from the CRTC, VSYNC was
used to generate the system interrupt. As Commodore probably
didn't want to break older programs that actually checked
VIA PB5, they also used VSYNC on this pin. 
</p><p>
VSYNC as used on VIA PB5, however, is directly connected to the 
actual analog video circuitry in the PET monitor.
It seems that this change made the PET "vulnerable"
to the Poke. A possible explanation, however, is quite technical and
given in the next section.
    </p></div></div><div class="h2"><div class="h2h"><div class="h2t"> </div><h2><a name="details" id="details">Technical Detail</a></h2></div><div class="h2c"> <p>To understand the nature of the problem one has to know a bit about
digital and analog electronics.
First of all, we cannot assume that what we are talking about is purely
digital in the sense that all voltages are 0V or 5V, and none else.
Secondly we have to look at the databooks of the components involved,
the 6522 and several TTL ICs. I will mention the necessary detail when
needed.
</p><p>
What I will describe below has solely been analyzed from the schematics
of the different PET models. Later I have confirmed the voltage drop
with an oscilloscope on my CBM 8296.
Further analysis has been done by Tech Tangent and Adrian as mentioned.
    </p><h3><a name="oldpet" id="oldpet">The old PETs</a></h3> <p>The non-CRTC PET generate the retrace signal with the "master timing"
electronics, where it was produced by a 74LS08 (C6 in the
2001 schematics on the CBM archive). This signal is also used in IC E9 (input to 74LS20) to blank
the video signal on off-screen times. The signal itself, as I can see it,
is not fed to the (analog) video (CRT i.e.) electronics.
This means that the relevant input is a TTL input that recognizes everything
above 2.4V as a logic 1.
</p><p>
In normal operation C6 produces the signal that is 5V for screen active
and 0V for off-screen.
The "speed" poke now is to set PB5 to a low output.
However already in this case we have an unhealthy situation:
The 74LS08 drives the line high and low according to the timing, but
the VIA always pulls the line low. Obviously the 74LS08 wins, because
otherwise the screen would be blank anyway (due to E9, 74LS20), but probably
only because a TTL input recognizes even 2.4V only as a logic 1
(The datasheets
say that the TTL output can source 0.4mA to pull a line
high, and the VIA6522
can drain 1.6mA. This would mean that the 6522 can always
drain the line to a low voltage level. Why does the 74LS20 then
read a logic 1, i.e. more than 2.4V? The solution is that the
74LS08 sources 0.4mA in normal operation, but
it can source up to
20-100mA under short circuit conditions. A 6522 draining up to 1.6mA
can surely count as some kind of short circuit condition.
For normal operation (&lt; 0.4mA) it is guaranteed that the output
voltage is around 5V. For short circuit conditions the voltage is
less. As the TTL input (74LS20) still reads the logic 1, we can
conclude that the TTL output still sources enough current to
keep the voltage above 2.4V. We have to assume that sourcing
4 times the nominal current will lower the voltage considerably
from 5V, though. I would be grateful if someone
could measure those voltages with an oscilloscope to confirm
that theory.)
</p><p>
The timing for the Cathode Ray Tube is still done by the master timing
electronics, i.e. VSync and HSync signals are not influenced by the
poke.
      </p><h3><a name="vulnerable" id="vulnerable">Possibly vulnerable PETs</a></h3>

</div>
<p>When the video electronics was changed to use the CRTC chip, there was
no more master timing electronics. So another way had to be found to
generate the signal, esp. for the system interrupt.
Therefore the CRTC VSync signal is used as a replacement signal.
Again we have the same situation as above. One TTL output and a VIA 6522
driving the signal against each other.
We will expect the same voltage drop as above.
</p><p>
This effect has in fact been observed - I have measured the VDRIVE
pin of my 8296 with and without the poke.
Without the poke I get a signal with an average voltage of about
4.7V to GND. With the poke, however, I get an average voltage of
1V to GND! The picture on my oscilloscope indeed shows that the voltage
difference between the high level (display) and low level (retrace)
with the poke reduces to about a fourth of the voltage without the
poke!
</p><p>
In the CRTC PET the signal is
not read by a TTL input, but is directly fed to the analog CRT electronics.
The first input circuitry of the VSync signal seems to be the ramp
generator.
</p><p>
The VDrive input of the early 8032 schematics (see
8032/321448.gif)
expects 5V for onscreen and 0V for flyback.
As long as the Vdrive input is (much?) higher than 1.93V
a current is simply integrated to get the ramp voltage (for the
vertical beam position, see oscilloscope
point (4)) A diode (D602) lets the TTL output draw the charge of C601 and the
ramp generator goes to 0 when the VSync input goes to 0
(see oscillscope picture (3) &amp; (4))
The DC voltage at (4) is around 1.93V (so the schematics says).
</p><p>
Now apply the poke to set Via PB to low output. If
the ramp goes above the
voltage of the TTL level (that might be lower than 5V because the VIA
draws it) the ramp just flattens off (which differs from my initial assumption).
I don't say that the ramp is now steeper. I only say that the
ramp might be stopped earlier. 
This effect is seen in Tech Tangent's video on his scope measurements.
</p><p>
The result of this seems to be that the video display shrinks vertically, and
while about the upper half looks almost normal, the lower half is more and more
compressed into a single horizontal line - what you would expect if the ramp
responsible for vertical movement flattens off.
</p><p>
The effect did not happen on old PET, because the VIA was not connected
to the VSync signal, but to the video signal generation, and thus restricted
to the board itself.
      </p><h3><a name="fixed" id="fixed">Fixed PETs</a></h3> <p>Commodore seem to have been noticed of this behaviour and they
changed the video electronics:
Later (see 8032034.gif)
the analog electronics has been replaced by an integrated circuit,
a TDA 1170. This could probably handle the reduced Vsync voltage.
</p><p>
In fact I even tried the poke on my 8296 with connected screen.
As a late model I assumed it has the fix, but kept my finger close
to the reset button, though.
As far as I can see from the screen the CRT now simply does not
get any sync anymore, the screen just moves vertically.
      </p></div></div><div class="h2"><div class="h2h"><div class="h2t"> </div><h2><a name="summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2></div><div class="h2c"><p>
	What do we learn from this?
</p><p>
	First, the fast print poke is not the killer poke it is 
	assumed to be. Of course there still may be long-term effects
	of two output signals fighting each other, so the poke
	is not recommended anyway, even at the old machines it
	was written for.
</p><p>
	Secondly, to protect the old hardware, a resistor 
	from VIA PB5 to the signal, or even to ground could 
	do the job. Look out for a video from Adrian's digial basement 
	for that.
</p><p>
	Thirdly, still not all is safe yet. Especially with the CRTC
	timing can be programmed very freely, and could still be
	put into such a mode that it could fry the screen electronics.
	For example the space invadors code shown in the last frames
	of the video jump into the PET's editor ROM, only to set
	the horizontal total number of characters to zero... it
	was expecting some part of the interrupt routine instead
	from the old PET. So keep your finger on the power switch
	when running unknown software.
