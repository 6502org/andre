<a name="topanchor" id="topanchor"></a><h1>The 65k project - Feature Discussion</h1><p class="copyright">(C)
2010-2010 André  Fachat</p> 
<div class="overview"><p>	
	This page discusses and defines the features of the <em>65k</em> processor family, thus acts as the
	requirements definition for the new processor.
	</p><p>
	All requirements are based on the original NMOS 6502 processor, using the 
	"legal" opcodes. The 65k should run original NMOS 6502 code without modifications.
	</p><p>
	Goal of these requirements is that they should be:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Implementable - it should be possible to actually implement them...</li>
		<li>Useful - A feature should be reasonably easy to use and provide 
			features that are deemed missing in the 6502</li>
		<li>Simple - apply the KISS principle ("Keep It Simple Sweetheart"), i.e. basically
			try to minimize the lines of code to implement the features.</li>
		<li>Elegant - make an elegant design. This is not really a measurable goal, but a
			goal nevertheless.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>On one hand the processor should fit use cases for embedded systems. It could 
	implement a complete system-on-a-chip with a little ROM, some RAM, and I/O in a single
	FPGA. As a CPU-only it should also be a 
	(more or less) direct replacement for the 6502, with additional features
	e.g. in terms of wider registers. On the other hand it should provide - maybe in a 
	different packaging - extended linear address space and features comparable to 
	about an early 68k processor.</p>

	Differences for example to the 6504 consisted of how many address lines were routed from the
	core to the chip's outside.
	</p><p>
	Providing the right solution from embedded solutions to personal computing requires that the
	core can be customized, providing different features for different requirements.
	An embedded system or a 6502 replacement may not need any MMU or virtualization, but 
	can very much profit from wider registers and wider arithmetics.
     </p>
     <p class="conclusion">
	The 65k will provide a modular implementation. The minimum core will provide 6502-like features
	with wider registers. Virtualization, MMU, Cache, and different bus width may be modular options.
	More details to follow in the processor roadmap and the specs.
     </p><h2><a name="virtual" id="virtual">Virtualization</a></h2><div class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top</a></div><p>The 6502 does not have any virtualization features. Virtualization in its strongest form 
	- "Full Virtualization" - 
	means that a program running in a virtual machine can not distinguish the virtual machine it runs
	in from a real processor. In particular this means that an unaltered operating system for that
	processor can run in a full-virtualization-virtual-machine on that processor.
	The efficiency argument defines that the uncritical processor opcodes 
	executed in the virtual machine are executed natively on the processor. The critical operations
	are those that modify the system resources, like I/O, or processor status registers - not the
	arithmetic flags, but the system flags like "I" - on the 6502 SEI would be a critical opcode.
	The virtual machine monitor must be in complete control of those resources.
     </p><p>
     	A common way to handle critical operations is to "trap-and-emulate". When such an operation
	is detected, the processor traps into the virtual machine monitor (also known as hypervisor)
	and the opcode is emulated. This can even be required for simple reads or writes to I/O address
	space!
     </p><p>
	Partial virtualization does not provide enough virtualization to run an unaltered operating
	system in the virtual machine. 
     </p><p>
	Virtualization in the 6502 world has not been implemented yet, as the 6502 has no hardware
	protection features. A virtualized 6502 has to</p>
	<ul>
	<li>provide a virtual address space for the virtualized 6502</li>
	<li>processor registers can be stored away on context switches to the hypervisor similar to interrupts</li>
	<li>interrupts must be caught by the hypervisor and dispatched to the virtualized 6502 as needed
		This requires specific placement of interrupt vectors</li>
	<li>I/O address space must be trapped</li>
	<li>Some 6502 instructions must be made privileged or be virtualized, like the SEI instruction, to
		fulfill the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirement.</li>
	<li>All registers - including memory management registers(!) - must be readable, or be available
		only to privileged instructions, so that the hypervisor can monitor changes. This
		has interesting implications for example when an operating system that uses page tables
		is virtualized. Page tables are stored in main memory, but to track changes by the 
		virtualized operating system, the hardware MMU can not be used. These page tables are
		tracked by page faults on write, the entries translated and written to the physical MMU.
		This process can have a severe performance impact.</li>
	</ul>
     <p class="conclusion">
	The 65k will provide partial virtualization, with a) a hypervisor and a user space mode, 
	b) virtualization of critical CPU resources like the "I" flag, 
	c) trapping of critical opcodes when in user space mode, 
	d) virtual memory and I/O address mappings that can only be changed in hypervisor mode,
	e) interrupt virtualization
     </p><p class="conclusion">
	With these features, the 65k provides enough virtualization to run a pure 6502 operating system
	in a virtual machine.

These three registers serve
	as accumulator and index registers, and are each 8 bit wide.
	Lacking 16 bit operations is one of the main issues with the 6502 in modern times.
	So the goal of the register expansion is to provide 16 bit registers and arithmetic operations.
     </p><h3><a name="regexp816" id="regexp816">Register expansion in the 65816</a></h3><p>
		The 65816 has 16 bit registers as well. It expands the existing 8 bit registers
		to 16 bit using a mode bit. This bit (actually two, one for the AC and one for XR/YR
		is being set by a special instruction. When it is set, the register operations are 
		performed on all 16 bit, but using the original opcodes. I.e. an opcode
		<pre>A9 00 : LDA #$00</pre> becomes <pre>A9 00 00 : LDA #$0000</pre> for example.
		</p><p>
		The registers are always used as 16 bit. Modifying AC with an 8 bit width opcode
		leaves the upper 8 bit unchanged. This has strange consequences, when an 8 bit
		AC is being transferred into a 16 bit XR or YR. The unmodified high byte is transferred
		as well, resulting in a value that maybe was not wanted.
		</p><p>
		This approach has advantages and disadvantages. First of all, the 16 bit code can
		be basically as short as the 8 bit code (not counting the larger data). 
		On the other hand, switching between 8 bit and 16 bit operations requires
		an extra instruction. Also it introduces as "hidden state" into the program. A program
		is interpreted differently (and quite differently) depending on a mode bit 
		that is evaluated at runtime. 
		Depending on the mode bit an opcode can have a different length.
		So the assembler program, as well as disassemblers
		(be they code or human)
		always need to know what mode (8 or 16 bit) the code is meant for.
		</p><p>
		This situation led me to look for alternatives to get 16 bit operations.
		</p>
	<h3><a name="regexpalt1" id="regexpalt1">Alternative 1: New Registers</a></h3><p>
		The first idea to add 16 bit registers to the 6502 is to add new 16 bit 
		registers <code>U,V,W</code> that work as 16 bit accumulator and index registers.
	</p><p>
		My first naive design approach is in <a href="65k opcodes alternative 1.txt">65k opcodes alternatives 1.txt</a>
	</p><p>
		The approach shown in the file has a number of drawbacks:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It makes the system even more "non-symmetric". The new registers have different capabilities than their
			8 bit counterparts. Already on the original 6502, the X and Y registers are not completely symmetric
			and these registers make the situation even worse.</li>
		<li>Each new operation consumes an extra opcode, filling up the opcode space
			quite quickly.</li>
		<li>Linked with the missing symmetry - it might be easier to implement these registers with an own
			complete ALU and internal busses. This would require more logic to implement and thus more chip estate</li>
		<li>It's not elegant, it would violate the design goals from above</li>
	</ul>
	<p>On the other hand they keep the code small and make fetching the code faster.</p>
	<h3><a name="regexpalt2" id="regexpalt2">Alternative 2: Prefix Bytes</a></h3><p>A Prefix Byte modifies the behaviour of the opcode following the prefix byte. Prefix bytes have a long
		history, they reach back to the Z80 and maybe even further. Also the 6809 used them to expand the opcode space.
		There are two types of prefix bytes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Modifier prefix: the following opcode is basically the same as before, but modified for example by using a 
			different number of bits (8 bit vs. 16 bit) or different registers</li>
		<li>Multi-byte opcodes: a single byte starting a two-byte opcode enables 256 new opcodes in an otherwise 
			single-byte opcode machine. These two-byte opcodes need not have to have anything in common with their
			single-byte counterparts.</li>
	</ul>
		<p>The Z80 for example used both types of prefix bytes.</p>
		<p>To expand the 6502 registers a prefix byte could be used that modifies the existing opcode to use registers
		with an expanded number of bits</p>
	<ul><li><a href="http://books.google.de/books?id=tfP4UND566AC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;lpg=PA280&amp;dq=prefix+bytes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SmY9zqmD8h&amp;sig=x06ib73uLa0bb5ZYzI1rlrqHAIc&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=md-VTLm5M8vMswby3clk&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwCA" target="_blank" class="extlink">Write Great Code page 280 (Google Books) - about 80x86 prefix bytes</a> </li></ul><h3><a name="regexpcomp" id="regexpcomp">Comparison</a></h3><p>Here is a comparison of the different approaches to expand the 6502 register width:</p>

	<tr><th>Description</th><td>"Hidden state" mode bits switch the existing registers and opcodes between 8 and 16 bit</td>

	</table>
	<h3><a name="regexpconcl" id="regexpconcl">Conclusion</a></h3><p>All options basically compare at the same level. The difference is in how I weigh the different options.
	WDC obviously has chosen to go for the small code size route, taking the cost of extra switching opcodes between 8 bit and
	16 bit operations. 
	</p><p>
	I don't weigh the code size as much. For me it is important to not use hidden state in the CPU as an architectural principle,
	so I weigh the option to switch between 8 and 16 bit operation higher. Also that allows me to easily use short 8 bit
	code sparsly intermingled with 16 bit operations.
	</p><p>
	The option to add new registers and new opcodes requires to add new registers to the processor, requiring more 
	chip estate. These registers are not "symmetric" to the existing ones (different width) and require new opcodes, maybe
	even a new ALU. Although this was my first design approach, this complexity rules it out.
	</p><p class="conclusion">
	The 65k will use <em>modifier prefix bytes</em> to extend the existing registers and opcodes to 16 bit width.
	</p><h2><a name="signext" id="signext">Sign extension handling</a></h2><div class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top</a></div><h3><a name="signext816" id="signext816">65816, 80x86 Sign extension handling</a></h3><p>In a 65816 all registers are always used as 16 bit registers.
	As mentioned above, the 65816 does not modify the high byte of the 16 bit AC
	register when modifying the lower 8 bit only. This is similar to the behaviour of the
	80x86 architecture, that when computing 8- or 16-bit values no extension happens.
	</p><p>
	This approach is - in case of the 80x86 - also motivated by the fact that historically the 16 bit
	registers actually are two 8 bit registers combined.
	In the case of the 65816 the AC high byte can be used to "store" extra values that can be swapped
	into AC low byte with the <code>XBA</code> opcode.

	At least the 80x86 seems to have extra instructions to sign-extend a register.
	</p><h3><a name="signextauto" id="signextauto">Automatic Extension</a></h3><p>Similar to the automatic setting of the status register bits (Z, N for example)
	in the 6502, the processor could automatically extend the sign of an operation.
	This could have advantages when the resulting value is a relative value. It would then
	automatically preserve whether the value is positive or negative.
	</p><p>
	The only operation with relative values is the branch operation. Here the default is 
	8 bit - but not even a register value.
	</p><h3><a name="signextforce0" id="signextforce0">Force Zero</a></h3><p>
	The 65816 uses a different behaviour for AC and the index registers. The high byte of the
	XR and YR registers is forced to all zeros when 8 bit index register operation is selected.
	This allows to use increment/decrement opcodes without caring about the register size.
	</p><h3><a name="signextconcl" id="signextconcl">Conclusion</a></h3><p>
	In a "6502 mode" of the 65k, the high byte could always be zero when not using 16 bit
	registers at all. 8 bit operations would only modify the low 8 bits, leaving the others
	to zero.
	Only care would have to be taken to set the high byte to zero when going back
	from 16 bit to 8 bit operations.
	</p><p>
	A new instruction could be used to clear a register completely - no matter what number of bits
	the register internally has (this should preferably a single-byte opcode to even provide 
	improvement over the original 6502).
	</p><p class="conclusion">
	The 65k will not automatically extend the sign from an 8 bit operation to the full
	register width. It will instead provide extension opcodes to extend sign, zeros, or ones.
	It will also provide separate instructions to clear the full register.
	</p><h2><a name="regnum" id="regnum">Number of Register</a></h2><div class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top</a></div><p>The 6502 has three main registers, <code>AC, XR, YR</code>. 
	Compared to other (larger) processors this is a very low number. The 68k for example
	has 8 address and 8 data registers - each 32 bit wide. 
	So how can the number of registers be increased?
     </p><h3><a name="regnumset" id="regnumset">Register Sets</a></h3><p>Register sets duplicate (or multiply) an existing set of registers with the
		same set of features, and make them
		available via specific exchange instructions. The Z80 for example provides a second set of 
		registers (the <em>'</em> registers) that are supposed to be used by fast interrupt
		routines for example. 
	</p><h3><a name="regnumzp" id="regnumzp">Zeropage as Registers</a></h3><p>The 6502 has a specific addressing mode, zeropage, addressing the lowest page
		in memory. The zeropage location is determined
		by the second byte of the opcode. <pre>LDA $12</pre> for example puts the value from
		zeropage location $12 into the accumulator. The zeropage location could be interpreted
		as a register number.
	</p><p>
		Unfortunately even though the zeropage provides 256 bytes, it still is a scarce resource
		and also requires a memory access - which makes it slower than a simple register access.
		The 65816 provides a direct register to move the zeropage to anywhere in bank 0.
	</p><h3><a name="regnumnew" id="regnumnew">Additional, Separate Registers</a></h3><p>The processor could simply get new registers in addition to the existing ones.
		In contrast to register sets this would mean new opcodes for operations on these
		new registers.
	</p><p>
		As the 6502 has no means of "numbering" registers, there is no easy means of
		extending the existing operations with new registers. A separate set of
		operations would have to be implemented, a prefix to existing opcodes would not be enough.

	Zeropage register access is actually simple and "known" - the operations already exist in the

	<h2><a name="addrexp" id="addrexp">Address Expansion</a></h2><div class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top</a></div><p>
	The 6502 has a 16 bit address bus. This amounts to a whopping 64 kByte of memory.
	Even already the old and famous C64 already had some bank switching schemes to expand the address
	space to more than that. So there is a need to expand the number of address lines available.
	</p><p>
	Also the stack registers and stack size are important here. The 6502 stack is only
	256 byte long - and needs to be expanded for larger systems as well.
	</p><p>
	One goal is to extend the address space beyond the original 64k. On the other hand it
	should be possible to run 16 bit programs in all of the expanded memory. This can only
	be achieved by some kind of address translation.
	</p>
	<div class="sidenote">A Commodore PET would need 5 memory areas (if you don't count unmapped memory):
	up to 32k RAM, 2k video RAM (I/O), 24k ROM ($8800-$e7ff), 256 Byte I/O, and 4.75k ROM ($e900-$ffff).
	A Commodore 64 would need even more memory areas: 8 (depending on memory configuration. Using power
	on default): 0-1 CPU register, ~1k RAM ($0002-$03ff), 1k video RAM ($0400-$07ff), 38k RAM ($0800-$9ffff), 8k ROM ($a000-$bfff), 4k RAM ($c000-$cfff),
	4k I/O ($d000-$dfff), 8k ROM ($e000-$ffff). This could be reduced to 6 if a "low priority" RAM mapping
	for the whole 64k could be used that is being overlayed by the other mappings.</div>
	<p>
	Switching the memory translation should be efficient, and as far as possible done in hardware.
	One test use case would be to switch from a simulated Commodore PET to a simulated Commodore 64
	memory environment.
	</p><p>
	In addition to relocation, the memory management coming with the address expansion 
	should allow for protection and sharing. Protection means that a process must not be able
	to access or modify memory areas it should not access or modify without permission. 
	This "prevents a malicious or malfunctioning program from interfering with the operation
	of other running programs" (Wikipedia on Memory management, link below).
	The other feature that should be possible is share memory areas between processes as a fast means
	of interprocess communication. A server process for example could directly write data into
	the calling process' memory.
	</p><p>
	The location of the reset and interrupt vectors also needs to be discussed. 
	If they stay at <code>$FFFC-$FFFF</code>, they would probably be in the middle of the 
	system's RAM instead of ROM. On the other hand RAM is faster than ROM these days.
	</p>
     <h3><a name="addrexpnat" id="addrexpnat">Natural Address Expansion</a></h3><p>
	One goal is to make the address expansion as "natural" as possible. This means similar to
	how absolute (16 bit) addressing expands zeropage addressing, larger address space
	addressing modes should expand the old 16 bit addressing. A consequence of this is
	that the PC, the program counter has the full number of address bits. 16 bit addressing
	would simply address the low 64 kByte of memory.
	</p><p>
	There is one caveat with this approach though - return addresses are two byte on the stack.
	A JSR from outside the low 64k requires more than two byte on the stack, and also an own
	RTS code to use these three bytes. This is probably the reason why WDC decided on their
	banking approach.
	</p><h3><a name="addrexp816" id="addrexp816">65816 Address Expansion: Bank Registers</a></h3><p>The 65816 still has a 16 bit program counter register (PC). This
	register is extended by an 8 bit Program Bank Register (PBR) to give
	a 24 bit physical address.
	</p><p>
	Virtual data addresses are also still 16 bit values, and are extended by 
	a Data Bank Register (DBR) to provide a 24 bit physical address.
	The program counter can thus not cross bank boundaries, it wraps around from 
	$XXFFFF to $XX0000. Only special instructions that modify the PBR change the
	execution bank.
	</p><p>
	"Direct" addressing modes - formerly known as zeropage addressing - however 	
	is determined by the 16 bit Direct register (D) and always results in a 
	physical address in bank 0 ($000000-$00FFFF). Also the stack can only be in 
	bank 0 - its position is determined by the stack high byte register.

	</p><h3><a name="addrexpcsa" id="addrexpcsa">CS/A65 Address Expansion: MMU</a></h3><p>The <a href="../../csa/index.html">CS/A65</a> computer expands the 6502 CPU
	with an MMU, that maps any of the 16 4k-blocks of virtual (CPU) address space into 
	256 4k-blocks physical address space. The physical address space is 
	1 MByte and filled with RAM and ROM. The later versions also include memory management
	features like "no-execute", "write-protect" and "not-mapped" bits.
	This approach is commonly called paging.
	</p><p>The instruction pointer is still always 16 bit, as the CPU only sees 16 bit
	virtual address space.
	</p><p>Using this MMU requires to load the up to 16 MMU registers during a context switch.
	This can prove costly in a multitasking operating system.
	</p><p>
	Modern systems use a slightly different approach. The program only sets a memory address
	to the MMU, and the MMU then loads the mappings from these memory locations - as needed.
	The loaded "Page Table Entries (PTEs)" are stored in a "Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)".
	</p><p>Loading PTEs on demand however, can make opcode timing non-deterministic - when crossing
	an MMU block boundary an extra memory access to read the PTE may be inserted.

In the 
	8088/8086 the segment register was 16 bit. Shifted 4 bits to the left was used as base 
	address for a 64k window into the 1 MByte physical address space.
	</p><p>Since the 80286 the segment register content points to a descriptor table in memory, 
	that describes the segment. This description includes the - physical - base address, segment
	size (which is being checked), write protection and execute-only protection. 
	</p><p>
	Segmentation has the advantage that it can quickly be changed for example in case of a 
	context switch.
	</p><p>
	Newer 80x86 also use an MMU and paging in addition to segmentation.
	</p><p>
	The 80x86 can have a 16 bit, 32 bit or 64 bit instruction pointer, depending
	on the mode of operation. The 16 bit is extended with a 48 bit value to create
	a 64 bit virtual address space. The 32 bit instruction pointer is zero-extended.
	</p><p>
	"Canonical addressing" means that all unused address bits on the upper end (say address bits
	63 down to 48 when address bits 0-47 form the physical address) are either all zeros or all ones.

	The PowerPC actually has two different types of address translation. The Block Address Translation (BAT
	Registers map variable sized memory regions from virtual to physical ("real" in PowerPC terms) 
	addresses. There is only a limited number of these registers. The Segmented Translation
	"breaks virtual memory into segments, which are divided into 4 kByte pages, each representing
	physical memory". 
	</p><p>
	For segmented translation, the virtual address is split into segment number, page address, and byte
	within the block. The segment number is used to look up a segment id, that is hashed with the page
	address, the hash is then used as index in the page table to retrieve the real page number.
	This lookup is cached, however, in TLBs.
	</p><p>
	For block address translation, which seems to be more interesting here, there are four (resp. eight)
	block address translation CPU registers each for data and instructions. 
	Each BAT includes a virtual block address, and a block length definition, that allows to match 
	virtual address blocks from 128 kByte to 
	256 MByte. The virtual address is truncated to the "block length", and OR'd with 
	the real page number for that block, to retrieve the physical address.
	</p><p>
	The advantage of this approach is that due to the variable size, only a few entries suffice to
	map large memory areas. 
	</p><p>
	Block address translation is not implemented in all PowerPC processors, notably not in the G4 and G5.
	But it is used in the 4xx embedded processors.

	virtual machine and not on real hardware. The 65k should provide virtualization to such an
	extent that a normal 6502 operating system could run in the virtual machine.
	</p><p>
	Providing address space virtualization requires that any changes to the memory management
	subsystem are privileged operations and must be trapped when executed in user space mode.
	</p><p>
	When trapped, the processor enters hypervisor mode, and must be able to find out what a
	virtual address means in the physical address space. A specific instruction, possibly
	an opcode prefix could calculate a) the effective virtual address of an opcode, and 
	another instruction could then translate this virtual address to a physical address.
	The other way around is not possible, as a physical address could be mapped multiple times.
	</p><h3><a name="addrexpcomp" id="addrexpcomp">Comparison</a></h3><p>
	Comparing the different approaches above, there are two main approaches, MMU and BAT.
	A paged MMU is used by CS/A65, as well as all modern CPU architectures (above a certain size).
	They have evolved to provide different page sizes, from 4k as in the beginning up to 4M sizes.
	The BAT approach - conceptually an extension to the segmentation - on the other side provides
	differently sized segments from the start, and can map these segments to physical memory.
	Systems using segmentation or BAT have evolved to include paged mapping as well though.
	</p><p>
	All approaches can use TLBs - a translation cache - to speed up the mapping for addresses
	recently used.

		A good example of how a memory model has been refined in the light of
		upcoming multicore processors is the Java programming language memory model.
	</p><p>
		I will not go further into this discussion, but present the following conclusion.
	</p><p class="conclusion">
		To allow the implementation of a proper "happens-before" relationship, the
		 65k will provide memory barrier instructions to a) flush all writes to memory,
		and b) flush the read cache, both in total and for a given address (maybe address
		range).

	The 6502 has a two-staged interrupt process. The standard IRQ interrupts the CPU, which 
	then passes the PC and the status to the stack, fetches the interrupt vector and continues
	execution there. The IRQ can be prevented by setting the "I" flag in the processor status
	register. The NMI works similar, but can not be prevented. While the IRQ is level-triggered,
	the NMI is edge-triggered to prevent an infinite loop.
	</p><p>
	More modern CPUs have multiple interrupt lines, where each interrupt has a different priority.
	A CPU being in a specific interrupt level can be interrupted by a higher level interrupt.
	</p><h3><a name="addrexpcomp" id="addrexpcomp">Comparison</a></h3><p>The features mentioned above work at different parts of the architecture.
		The ABORT functionality is a functionality of the processor core - each register
		must have a shadow copy, that is updated only when the operation completed
		successfully (i.e. without an ABORT).
		</p><p>
		The read-only, no-execute etc bits are features of the memory management unit,
		not of the processor core. 	
		A separate component can then use these bits - together with the CPU's 
		R/-W, SYNC etc outputs - to generate the CPU's ABORT input.
		</p><p>
		The bus synchronization can be implemented by signals that the CPU generates
		(either ML, or one signal for LL/SC each), that are passed through the
		MMU and/or Cache, and are used by an external arbiter to synchronize the
		multiple processors.
	</p><h3><a name="addrexpconcl" id="addrexpconcl">Conclusion</a></h3><p class="conclusion">
		The 65k core will provide the fetch type signals (RDY, or VPA/VDA).
		It will have an ABORT input to provide for an opcode rollback.
	</p><p class="conclusion">
		The 65k MMU will provide at least read-only, no-execute, and not-mapped
		bits for each memory location. A separate component will use these 
		bits to detect bus error conditions and create the ABORT signal.
	</p><p class="conclusion">
		The processor bus interface will provide tri-state bus drivers, as well as 
		an arbiter interface (BE, RDY), so the external
		bus can be multiplexed. This includes ML resp. LL/SC signals for an
		interprocess synchronization.
	</p><p class="conclusion">
		In addition to the IRQ and NMI interrupt signals, the CPU has at least two
		more intermediary interrupt lines with interrupt prioritization. This
		includes appropriate opcodes and interrupt vectors.

	<h2><a name="memif" id="memif">Memory Interface</a></h2><div class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top</a></div><p>
	The 6502 has an 8 bit wide memory interface. With given clock frequency this limits
	the maximum memory bandwidth. The bandwidth can only be increased by increasing the 
	memory bus width.
	</p><p>
	Additionally a cache can be used to improve the memory bandwidth - by not requiring to read
	some data when it is in the cache already.
	</p>
     <h3><a name="memifwide" id="memifwide">Wide Memory bus</a></h3><p>Depending on the processor option, the memory bus could be 8, 16, or even 32 bit wide.
	The processor core on the other hand has internal 8 bit (opcode, small registers), but also
	16 or maybe 32 bit reads and writes. Unfortunately the wide reads and writes are not always
	aligned with the memory width. 
	</p><p>
	An (unaligned) write of 16 bit on an odd address of a 
	16 bit may need a 16 bit read of the first address, modify its second byte, write back the 
	16 bit word, then read the second 16 bit address, modify its first byte and write it back.
	</p><p>
	Also an unaligned read of a wide data (or code) fragment could trigger two separate reads.
	In fact for reading a 16 bit absolute value on an 8 bit bus this is exactly what the
	6502 currently does.
	</p><p>
	On the other hand, reading say a 32 bit value from the PC contains a complete (6502) opcode
	and reads - in a single cycle - all those bytes that are needed to read the opcode and which
	the 6502 would need multiple cycles for.
	</p><p>
	A fully wide bus interface is not the whole solution, though. I/O chips for example usually only
	have an 8 bit interface. Mapping them on the memory bus would mean that their
	addresses would have two bytes or even four bytes address difference. This would not allow 
	any kind of old systems emulation, where I/O devices normally have consecutive addresses. 
	</p><h3><a name="memifcache" id="memifcache">Cache</a></h3><p>
	A cache only makes sense when the memory access is slower than the CPU can handle the data read.
	On the 6502 a cache does not make much sense - the processor can handle the data as fast as it
	comes in - it sometimes even needs "bogus" cycles where it does some internal work. 
	</p><p>
	On a 65k the situation might be different. If the core is run at, say 100 MHz, and memory
	can only deliver at 10 MHz, a cache very well makes sense. 
	</p><p>
	A cache can also help if the bus width is extended from 8 bit to say 32 bit. 
	The wide bus interface allows to read the complete (6502) opcode, plus the following opcode.
	discardng this information does not make sense, so instead of reading it again and again,
	it should be cached.
	</p><p>
	The data cache (if instruction and data are separate) should provide some kind of "zeropage"
	flag to give zeropage addresses priority in the cache, thus implementing the zeropage cache
	mentioned above.

	<h3><a name="memifconcl" id="memifconcl">Conclusion</a></h3>
	<p class="conclusion">The 65k will have different options for memory bus widths, each bus width
	requires read- and write-sequencers to break down wider or misaligned memory accesses.
	</p>
	<p class="conclusion">The BAT registers of the MMU will provide information about whether
	the external (physical) memory is native width (depending on processor option), or 
	8 bit for I/O.
	</p>
	<p class="conclusion">The 65k, when using a bus width larger than 8 bit will 
	cache the wide data read at least for the next access. Optionally a larger cache
	can be provided (Details to be determined).
