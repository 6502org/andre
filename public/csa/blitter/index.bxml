  <overview><p>Transfering a block of bytes from one memory location to another
	using the CPU can take a lot of time. A simple transfer loop using absolute
	addressing uses about 13 cycles per byte. Using zeropage indexed addressing 
	it takes even more. That is the reason why computers like the Amiga or the
	later Atari ST have block transfer engines, or PCs have DMA engines in the chipset.
	The 65816 chip even includes special opcodes to do block transfers, with a rate 
	of seven cycles per byte.
	</p><p>
	So I thought I should add a block tranfer engine to the CS/A system. 
	Back then in 2007 I did a first design - and utterly failed. It implemented
	two address registers, with a separate adder/incrementer and buffers for each address.
	So this took a whole lot of board space, and I wasn't able to actually place and 
	route it. You can see the design below as V1 as an example for how not to do it.
	</p><p>
	In 2010 I had a better look into CPU architectures, and I got the idea that
	I could build a blitter using something similar to a CPU architecture. Using 
	an architecture with address registers, shared busses, and a single ALU I was
	able to produce a new design (see V2 below) that does not need as much board
	space and that I was able to place and route with SMD technology.
	</p><p>
	In the <a href="works.html">How it works</a> page I have described how the
	board works in principle.

	<subsection toc="normal" name="Normal Usage">
		<desc><p>
		To transfer a block of continous data from one memory area to the next, do:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Set the LDADDR to the first address of the source memory block</li>
		<li>Set the STADDR to the first address of the target memory block</li>
		<li>Set the LDINC and STINC to 1</li>
		<li>Set the CNT to the number of bytes to transfer minus 1</li>
		<li>Set the control bits in register 15 - writing to this register starts the 
			process. For normal transfer set the register to $0c to use /MEMSEL,
			and don't set the CARRY and Complement bits</li>
		</ol><p>
		The address values are incremented directly after the transfer. I.e. after the
		transfer the address points to the address after the memory block.
		</p><p>
		The increment value is decremented after the transfer. The transfer stops when
		an underflow occurs in this process. I.e. after the transfer the CNT register
		holds $FF.
		</p><p>
		As the maximum number of bytes to transfer is 256 (by writing 255 into CNT), to transfer
		more data, multiple transfers have to be used. The registers are updated such
		that just writing to register 15 multiple times transfer multiple contiguous blocks.
		</p></desc>
	</subsection>
	<subsection toc="special" name="Special Features">
		<desc><p>
		Here are some special features:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><em>Reverse Transfer</em>: If you want to transfer data in reverse order, i.e.
		from a high address to a low address, you can use the Complement bits in the control
		register 15. For example to use an offset of minus one (-1), you need to set the
		INC register with $FF, and also set the corresponding Complement bit COMPL in the
		control register. This leads to an added offset of $FFFFF, which actually is like
		substracting one. By using a positive offset in one address and a negative offset
		in the other address, you can reverse the order of the data bytes in a memory block</li>
		<li><em>256 byte INC offset</em>: The INC register can only hold values up to 255.
		To implement a transfer that takes a byte off of each page - i.e. with an offset of
		256 byte - the CARRY control register bits can be used. The carry is used in the
		appropriate addition of the INC value to the address. Thus when the INC register
		is set to 255, and the carry is set, an offset of 256 is used for the transfer.</li>
		<li><em>I/O DMA</em>: The blitter can also be used to implement data transfer from
		an I/O address to memory and vice versa. Using a /IOSEL with an INC value of zero
		(and carry not set) in the load setup reads each byte from the same I/O address. </li>
		</ul>
		</desc>
	</subsection>
	<subsection toc="caveat" name="Caveats">
		<desc><p>
		There are some caveats when using the blitter:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>The block transfer is not interruptible. I.e. you possibly introduce a latency
		of about 512 cycles (256 bytes max transfer, one load and one store each).</li>
		<li>The blitter stops the bus with the RDY signal. This means that this signal
		is not available for a device to signal lower speed to the blitter.
		I.e. memory or I/O devices that use RDY cannot be used with the blitter.</li>

  <section toc="board" name="Board description">
     <desc><p>In the <a href="works.html">How it works</a> page the principles of operation
	are described. Here I'll describe some of the implementation details (of the V2 board).
     </p></desc>
     <subsection toc="dbus" name="Data Bus Separation">
	<desc><p>
	In the principle description the CPU data bus is connected to the INBUS drivers, the increment
	registers, the increment data buffer, and - not shown there - to the input as well as output
	of the data transfer register (where the transferred data is kept). This would put a lot
	of load on the actual CPU data bus. Therefore I added IC15, a data bus driver that separates
	the actual CPU data bus from the board data bus.
	</p></desc>
     </subsection>
     <subsection toc="logic" name="Logic Implementation">
	<desc><p>
	The system actually only uses a few bits of "state" if you don't count the address and increment
	registers. It must know if it is active, and when active it needs to know which operation it
	is doing - fetch or store. This state is defined in the signals /ACTIVE and FETCH/-STORE.
	In the 2.0 version these bits were determined by some RS-Flipflops, and all other logic
	was derived from that and implemented in two PAL chips. But my PAL burner is not that 
	reliable and I had a Xilinx 9536 CPLD around, so I decided to move everything into the CPLD
	- which is shown in the 2.1 version. Unfortunately the CPLD is about a few lines short of
	being able to include all the logic. So some small parts are still implemented as inverters
	and AND gates.
	</p><p>
	Note that the 2.1 board contains some "PIN" pads, to be able to easily use the remaining logic
	gates even though these chips are SMD...
	</p></desc>
     </subsection>
     <subsection toc="layout" name="Layout description">
	<desc><p>
	If you look at the layout, it is dominated by a five-by-four array of SOW20 chips with some
	smaller chips to the right. These implement the INBUS, OUTBUS and Increment busses as follows:
	</p><p>
	The first row of chips implements the Increment bus, with two '574 as increment value registers
	for fetch and store. Then there is IC24 ('245) to read out the increment bus, and IC23 ('245)
	to feed a zero increment into the adder.
	</p><p>
	To the right of that comes IC32 ('245) and IC25/IC28 (both '193) that implement the transfer counter.
	</p><p>
	The next three rows of ICs implement the address bits 0-7, 8-15 and 16-19 respectively, including
	their part of the INBUS and OUTBUS busses. From left to right First comes the address drivers 
	that are used to
	drive the OUTBUS to the CPU address bus. Then there are the two '574 that hold the fetch and store
	address values; then there is the data bus driver, connecting the INBUS with the CPU data bus.
	The right-most 20-pin chip is the ALU output driver, that drives the adder output onto the
	INBUS. The smaller chips to the right are '293 4-bit adders, implementing the actually "ALU" adder.
