Description for CS/A CPU65B/Plain board, version 2.0
----------------------------------------------------

whatsit	: CPU + RAM + ROM
I/O	: --
Mem	: --

The board is pretty straightforward. It maps the 8 or 32k static
RAM (IC5) to the lower 32k addresses. The upper 32k addresses are
divided between the I/O area ($e000-$efff or $e800-$efff, see J3) 
and the ROM (rest). 

The first half of IC2 selects the I/O area. The second half then 
enables either the /IOSEL line or the ROM (depending on the output
of the first half) as long as it is in the upper 32k addresses.

No I/O is directly on this board, nor can the memory be used from 
an external CPU. This is probably the most simple example of building
a 6502 CPU board for this bus.
