<h2>CS/A65 emulator (<a href="@WEBROOT@">A. Fachat</a>)</h2>
<p>
Long ago (or so it seems) I have added a CS/A65 emulation to the 
VICE emulator.
As you can see from the text below, it <strong>is</strong> an old 
emulator. Nevertheless it should still work. If I get the time,
I'll probably update it to the new VICE 1.0 code, some day...
</p><p>
The emulator is derived from the
PET emulator, and allows running an old version (1.3.3) of the OS/A65
operating system (Well, meanwhile it can run the new not-yet-published
version 1.4) A copy of the 1.3.3 ROM as well as the pre-1.4 csarom-1.3.94p
 is included. For more information see the
<a href="../index.html">GeckOS pages</a>. The source archive, a 
patched VICE 0.12.0.16
version can be found as <a href="vice.16-csa-20.tgz">vice.16-csa-20.tgz</a>.
Now even the hardware cursor of the 6545 crtc controller works, 
and it should be much faster (than previous versions, not compared to VICE
itself...) on slow machines now.
the <code>-20</code> version fixes a segmentation fault that could sometimes
occur, and also includes some rudimentary ACIA 6551 rs232 emulation.
</p><p> Some hints: <br>
You compile it with the usual "./configure", then "make xcsa" 
(it is not included in the normal build
procedure, but you can still build all other emulators with the ususal "make") 
and install it with "make install_xcsa". <br>
There are no RS232 devices emulated, only dummy devices
and the video device. On virtual terminal 1 a shell is running, on 
virtual terminal 2 a monitor is running. The "@" key switches between the
virtual terminals (4 with 40 cols "-video40" option, or 2 with 80 cols).
Drive C:-F: are IEEE drives 8-11, i.e. on drive 11 you find the Unix 
directory under VICE.
