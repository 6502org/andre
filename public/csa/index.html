<H2><a name="motivation">Motivation</a></H2>
<p><p>
		Why do I do all this? Good question. It all started with 
		modifications to my trusty old Commodore 64 (that I still own
		but rarely use, though). Together with a friend I developed
		a phone switching system so you could use multiple phones
		on a single phone line, with features like call forwarding,
		or conferencing. My friend built several revisions of the 
		6502-based hardware, while I wrote several revisions of 
		the software. It was much fun to do, but it never reached
		production status, though. When I started studying, I decided
		to build my own system with advanced features - and the 
		result was the original CS/A65 computer. </p>
		<p>One motivation was to actually implement and try out
		(then and now) 
		advanced features in microprocessor architecture. You
		can see that in the use of the MMU, or the planned coprocessor
		board. I also wanted it to be easily understandable, so 
		I decided not to use programmable logic chips but implement
		everything in standard logic chips. 
		Although nowadays FPGAs look very interesting (and advanced) :-)

	</p>
<H2><a name="dist">Distribution</a></H2>
<p>
<p>The boards, i.e. the schematics, and layout artworks are distributed
under the terms of the <a href="../osa/COPYING">GNU public license version 2</a>.
</p><p>
The <a href="bus-1.1.html">bus design</a> is completely in the public domain.
It can be used as long as any changes to the original specs are marked as such
(to not let incompatibilites slip in unnoticed).
</p>
	</p>
<H2><a name="overview">Introduction</a></H2>
<p>
	<p>The CS/A65 computer is a modular computer based on a passive
	backplane and a number of active boards. The system is based around
	the 6502 technology originating from the long gone MOS technologies.
	New chips, however, are available from other sources.</p>
	<p>The 6502 is an eight bit CPU with sixteen address lines.
	A prominent feature of the main CPU board is the MMU 
	that, together with the 20 bus address lines, allow for a megabyte
	of address space. This MMU is used in the <a href="../osa/index.html">GeckOS/A65</a> operating system for multitasking support.</p>
	<p>Many of the boards originated from my original plans to recreate
	a Commodore PET3032 computer - on which I got my first programming
	experiences. It has, however, grown way beyond this now.</p>
	<p>Some prominent examples for I/O boards are a SCSI interface, 
	as well as PC floppy interface, or a 6502 emulator.</p>
	<p>A software emulator based on the VICE commodore emulator
	is used for software development for the system</p>
	</p>
<H2><a name="general">General considerations</a></H2>
<H3><a name="othercpu">Other CPUs</a></H3>
<p>
<p>
Currently the system is based on the 6502 processor, although other
configurations (65816, 6809) should be possible. The software I use
for this systems is homemade and can be found on my
<a href="../osa/index.html">OS/A65</a> page. There are drivers and programs
for most of the hardware described below available.
</p>
	</p>
<H3><a name="bus">Bus</a></H3>
<p>
<p>
The bus used is the synchronous bus used in the 6502/6800/6809 CPU bus
interfaces. It has some additional lines, though...
A description of the bus interface is in
<a href="bus-1.1.html">bus.html</a>.</p>
	</p>
<H3><a name="tech">Technology</a></H3>
<p>
<p>
All ICs are standard Low-Power Shottky ('LS) or Advanced Low-Power Shottky
('ALS) TTL ICs. These ICs are still standard, although some of the ICs
seem to have been deprecated and are not <quote>ported</quote> to newer technologies like 'ALS.
</p><p>Also, getting documentation for the 8bit
stuff is getting more and more difficult. But there is an archive in
Finland, <a href="http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/documents/chipdata/index.html">http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/documents/chipdata/index.html</a>
that has most of the stuff. However there is a separate
<a href="../hwinfo/ls610/index.html">74LS610 page</a>.</p>
	</p>
<H3><a name="schem">Schematics</a></H3>
<p>
<p>
In the older schematics there are no bypass capacitors (buffering the supply
voltage for each IC separately)
that should be from Vcc to GND for each IC. Sometimes they are mentioned
in the parts list, though. Also there is no 100uF capacitor at the CS/A
bus connector between Vcc and GND, to buffer the supply voltage for the
board. These are always implict, so I didn't bother drawing them.
But you should use them anyway.
</p><p>
Most of the boards, esp. the I/O boards, are pretty straightforward.
That's why I concentrate on the special I/O and even then I will only go into
detail when necessary. You should have some basic understanding of
6502 hardware design.
</p><p>
In all mentionings I have just written 6502 or 6522 or 6821. These and
other chips exist in different flavors, and it is only save to assume
a that they are specified for 1MHz bus frequency only.
Check if you want a 2MHz system and use the appropriate faster models.
</p>
	</p>
<H3><a name="age">Age</a></H3>
<p>
<p>
Last but not least one remark. Some of the boards have been designed
as early as 1989, which means they are pretty old. Nowadays I would do some things
differently, the Reset circuitry is one example that can actually
be seen in the newer 2006 versions of the CPU boards for example.
</p><p>
The schematics on this page can be found either as PNG, xfig and gzipped 
postscript, in which case they are at least from 1999 or earlier, or
as <a href="http://www.cadsoft.de">Eagle</a> schematics and PNG, in 
which case they are from 2006 or later.
</p><p>
Nevertheless for the older boards 
I have mostly transcripted the schematics from my hand-drawing to
xfig format. Although I used quite some time to find any remaining error,
be warned, there still may be errors.
And my hand-drawing is still the authoritative source.</p>
<p>For the newer boards you can be pretty sure that the Eagle schematics
and board layout works when the board description indicates that I have
tested the board and found no problem.

<H2><a name="setups">Setups</a></H2>
<p>
	In this section some supported setups are described.

<H3><a name="caspaer">Caspaer</a></H3>
<p><div class="rightimg">
		<a href="gallery/caspaer.jpg"><img src="gallery/caspaer-small.jpg"></a><br>A Caspaer setup
		</div>
		The Caspaer (aka "CaSpAer65" ;-) setup is the base setup for the
		CS/A65 computer with a main CPU board, i.e. for an MMU setup.
		It consists of the <a href="cpu/index.html">CS/A65 CPU</a>, 
		<a href="bios/index.html">CS/A65 BIOS</a>, <a href="vdc/index.html">Video</a> and <a href="petio/index.html">PETIO</a> boards. 
		<ul>
		<li>It uses the current version of the boards, i.e. VDC 1.4,
		BIOS 3.0, PETIO 1.1 and CPU 2.0.</li>
		<li>It uses the PET method of generating the system interrupt,
		by using the extra cable from PETIO to VDC board to use
		the vertical retrace signal (This way no 50Hz generation in the
		power supply is necessary).</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
<H3><a name="legacy">CS/A65 legacy</a></H3>
<p>This setup uses the "old" versions of various boards. It
		is basically deprecated and only documented here as I still
		have such a setup and still want to use it... It uses the
		<a href="cpu/index.html">CS/A65 CPU</a>, <a href="bios/index.html">BIOS</a>, <a href="vdc/index.html">Video</a> boards,
		as well as the deprecated <a href="key/index.html">keyboard</a> and <a href="iec/index.html">IEEE488 boards</a>.
		<ul>
		<li>It uses the older version of the boards, i.e. VDC 1.3,
		BIOS 2.x, CPU 1.2, Keyboard 1.0 and IEEE488 1.1.</li>
		<li>It uses the legacy method of generating the system
		interrupt, that requires the 50Hz line on the CS/A65 bus
		to be powered by an external source, in my case by the
		power supply.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
<H3><a name="gecko">Gecko</a></H3>
<p>The Gecko computer is a single-board computer that can only
		use I/O boards on the CS/A bus, and has own peripherals 
		on the board. It has its own <a href="gecko/index.html">Gecko</a> page.
	</p>
<H3><a name="fat40">Fat40</a></H3>
<p>The Fat40 setup is similar to the Gecko setup in that the
		<a href="petcpu/index.html">PETCPU board</a> used is a small computer in itself.
		The setup, however, defines to use the <a href="vdc/index.html">Video</a> and <a href="petio/index.html">PETIO</a> boards as well, to simulate
		a Commodore PET 4032 with CRTC, aka "Fat40" - thus the name.
		The Fat40 setup has its own <a href="../cbmhw/ryofat40/index.html">Fat40 page</a>.
	</p>
<H3><a name="vc1581">VC1581</a></H3>
<p>The VC1581 setup also uses the <a href="petcpu/index.html">PETCPU</a> board, but uses the 
		<a href="drvio/index.html">DRVIO board</a> to emulate a Commodore VC1581 disk drive.
		The VC1581 setup has its own <a href="../cbmhw/ryo1581/index.html">VC1581 page</a>.
	</p>
<H2><a name="sw">Software</a></H2>
<p>
<p>
The software used is the <a href="../osa/index.html">GeckOS/A65</a>
operating system. It features the handling of the MMU, serial devices,
video output, floppy disk drives, and the newest versions even feature
TCP/SLIP (beta) and SCSI (alpha) support.
</p>
<p>
Some of the software development took place on a modified
VICE emulator, that now emulates a subset of the CS/A65 hardware.
Please check it out at its <a href="emu/index.html">site</a>.

<ul>
<li class="subitem">
<a href="cpu/index.html">CS/A65 CPU</a> 
		The main CPU board features an MMU, and newer versions also
		sport bus error condition detection. It is a CPU-only board

</li>
<li class="subitem">
<a href="cpu816/index.html">65816 CPU</a>

		Instead the 1MByte CS/A bus memory is mapped into the 16MByte 65816 address space.
		The CPU runs at a whopping 8MHz and the board includes 2MByte fast RAM, while
		the CS/A bus is clocked at 1MHz. It is a CPU-only board and needs the BIOS board
		to boot.

</li>
<li class="subitem">
<a href="bios/index.html">CS/A65 BIOS</a>

		This is a PET compatible keyboard interface, plus a
		ACIA 6551 based serial (RS232) interface. As the 6551
		is a rather rough-edged chip, and the keyboard interface
		is available with the PETIO board in a more compatible way, 
		this board is replaced by the PETIO and DUART boards.

<a href="iec/index.html">IEEE488 and CBM IEC</a> 
		This board implements a partially PET compatible IEEE488
		interface, plus a Commodore serial IEC bus as it is used
		in the C64 for example. In addition both busses can be used
		not only as master, but also as drive so that the CS/A65
		computer can be used as drive by the PET or C64. This 
		board is replaced by the PETIO and 
		DRVIO boards.

<H2><a name="memmap">Memory Map</a></H2>
<p>A memory map on the I/O memory addresses can now be found in the
		<a href="memmap.html">Memory Map page</a>.
	</p>
<H2><a name="numbering">Board numbering scheme</a></H2>
<p><p>The boards are numbered with a major and a minor version number,
		plus a letter denoting the revision of the board. So for
		example a video board is numbered "1.3E", means that 
		it is major version 1, minor version 3, and the fifth revision
		(E).
		</p><p>
		The revisions are changed when a compatible modification has
		been made - this can be a redraw of the schematics (e.g.
		with Eagle instead of xfig), or a minor bugfix (like 
		fixing the reset behaviour). It is also used when during
		development the initial bugs are shaken out (which may
		involve incompatible changes, though, see the DRVIO board...)
		</p><p>
		The minor version is increased when there is a 
		software-compatible extensions of the previous board. For
		example the 1.4 version of the VDC board, although the
		video connector has changed (composite is gone, but VCC
		is there now) it can be used very much like the V1.3
		versions (software-wise).
		</p><p>
		The major version number is increased by major and 
		incompatible changes. 
		For example the BIOS board is in its third major version:
		the first version used an ACIA as RS232 interface, the
		second one an UART instead. The third version is a complete
		redesign with the possibility to provide up to 512k RAM
		and/or ROM. It could be used like a version 2 board, but
		is a major change anyway, therefore a new major version.
		</p><p>
		I try to keep the numbering consistent, but I am only
		human ;-)
