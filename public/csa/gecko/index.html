<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>(c) 1997-1999 Andr&eacute; Fachat</h1>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P>In 1989, after my first semester at university, I made the first line
on the schematics for a small self-designed and self-built computer. This
computer, based on the 6502 CPU, has until 1992 become a small computer
system.</P>

<P>The new <strong><em><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Gecko</FONT></em></strong> system is conformant
to this system and has some quite nice features:</P>

<UL>
<LI>A&nbsp;fast serial <strong>RS232</strong> interface, using the 16550 UART&nbsp;with
FIFO, known from the PC&nbsp;world.</LI>

<LI>A <strong>serial IEC</strong> bus interface to the Commodore C64 and VC1541</LI>

<LI>An interface to infrared LEDs to <strong>remote control</strong> devices like
CD player or TV sets</LI>

<LI>A small <strong>keyboard</strong> interface</LI>

<LI>Up to 30 kByte ROM and 32 kByte RAM, with up to 2 kByte fully decoded
I/O space</LI>

<LI>Bus interface to standard CS/A peripheral interface cards</LI>
</UL>

<P>Software that is completed is:</P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="../../osa/index.html">GeckOS/A65 Multitasking OS</A></LI>

<LI>Filesystem for the Commodore 
VC1541 disk drive (in GeckOS/A65)</LI>

<LI>Multitasking shell with 
I/O&nbsp;redirection, including a 
machine language monitor (running over the serial line</LI>

<LI>Device for infrared control</LI>

<LI>A TCP/SLIP&nbsp;implementation to mount files from the PC&nbsp;via
serial line and SLIP&nbsp;protocol</LI>

</UL>

<P>Later there will be:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Let the filesystem allow accesses from the serial IEC bus - to access
files on the PC&nbsp;from the C64 for example.</LI>

<H3>From Theory to Practice - the Hardware</H3>

<P>
You can have a look at the real hardware of my prototype board at my 
<a href="../gallery/index.html#gecko">Gallery</a>.
<p>
In <strong><A HREF="gecko.ps.gz">gecko.ps.gz</A></strong> or 
<strong><a href="gecko.png">gecko.png</a></strong> is a drawn xfig schematics,
(in gnuzip'd postscript format or PNG) of the main board
that has all the above listed
interfaces. 
<P>On the left side is the 6502, the CPU. To the right follows an address
decoder, that produces the following memory map (which is the standard
map for CS/A computers, except for the I/O contents):</P>

<PRE>$0000 - $7FFF    RAM
$8000 - $E7FF    ROM
$E800 - $EFFF    I/O:
                $EC00-$EC0F     16550A UART
                $EC10-$EC1F     6522 VIA 
$F000 - $FFFF    ROM
</PRE>

<P>Further follows the RAM (either 8 or 32 kByte) and the ROM (8, 16 or
32 kByte). The next large chip is the 16550 UART serial interface. The
6522 is a standard chip of the 65xx family and has the rest of the interfaces.
On the right side is the <A HREF="bus.html">CS/A bus connector</A>. The
part below the dashed line actually is a simple I/O card, integrated on
the CPU card. All signals that cross the dashed line are available on the
bus connector, so that you have a simple example of how to implement your
own I/O cards (There is an exception - the CPU part and the I/O part share
IC14, IC15 and IC18, but that's just for convenience. They are used for the
RESET logic. You have to take a Schmitt-Trigger there, and an open collector
output. I usually use a 74LS14 with a following 74LS06). 
Here is the <A HREF="gparts.html">parts list</A>. </P>

<P>One thing is that the 1.8432 MHz crystal Q1, together with R14,
R15, C9, and C10 should be replaced with an oscillator like IC7. The oscillator
output should be connected to XIN, while XOUT should be not connected.
<BR>
I used to just connect the crystal to XIN and XOUT, but that doesn't work
with all types of crystal - it doesn't start oscillating... It's probably
only R15 missing then. </P>

<p> The UART not only has the RS232 interface, but I also use the OUT2
line to drive the system LED: the LED blinks if autodetection tests
fail when booting, for example. <br>
The VIA port A is used for a simple keyboard interface. Four lines are
driven for output, while four lines can be read. These eight lines
are buffered and there is a 10 pin conector with these lines and a
5 Volt power supply. I normally give the 4 output pins to an external
BCD-to-decimal decoder with Open collector outputs (74LS145). The up to 
10 outputs
are then given to a 10x4 keyboard matrix. The 4 output lines are then read
from the keyboard. This gives up to 40 keys. When using a 4-to-16 decoder,
you can have up to 64 keys.
<p>
The VIA PB7 output pin is used to drive the infrared circuitry. If it is
high (or set to input) then the circuit is inactive. Otherwise a 40 kHz
signal is produced with the help of R6 and C8. This signal is then driven
to the infrared LED. 
<p> The rest of port B is used for a Commdore compatible serial IEC
interface. This interface can be used as floppy or as a master (computer)
on the bus. As long if you don't have the software to run it as floppy,
disable the ATNA output by opening jumper J4. The ATNA circuitry
immediately pulls DATA low if the ATN line goes active and the computer
hasn't yet recognized that. But the bus master (sending the ATN) is 
therefore notified that a device is on the bus.
<hr>
<H3>The Software</H3>
The software available already is the Operating system 
<a href="../../osa/index.html">GeckOS/A65</a>, together with the shell for this system,
and a serial IEC filesystem. Also a small example for a infrared 
control is also implemented. <p>
If you get the OS/A65 operating system, and have my cross-assembler
<a href="../../misc/index.html#xa">XA</a>, you have to go to the main 
directory of the OS/A65 distribution tree and do a "make gecko.rom".
This produces the "gecko.rom" file, i.e. a 
32 kByte ROM image (with additional CBM two byte load address at the 
beginning!) This ROM image must be burned into a 32kByte EPROM and
put into the <em>Gecko</em> computer.
<p>
When the system comes up and detects an error, the LED is giving a blink code.
The code can be seen from the definitions in the OS/A file oa1str.def:
<pre>
/*        Hardware-Errors          */

#define   HE_ZP     &lt;-1         /* Zeropage RAM defective */
#define   HE_RAM    &lt;-2         /* not enough RAM (may be defective) */
#define   HE_IMEM   &lt;-3         /* memory handler init failed */
#define   HE_IDEV   &lt;-4         /* device handler init failed */
#define   HE_ISTR   &lt;-5         /* stream handler init failed */
#define   HE_IENV   &lt;-6         /* environment handler init failed */
#define   HE_ROM    &lt;-7         /* not enough Streams/Envs to handle all
                                   ROM autostart requests */
#define   HE_DEV    &lt;-8         /* error registering ROM device */
#define   HE_TASK   &lt;-9         /* no more active task! */
</pre>
If the LED blinks 7 times, then it's HE_ROM for example.
<p> 
After coming up, you have to connect a 9600 baud, 8N1 serial line terminal 
(or PC with terminal program) to the RS232 interface. You get the prompt
of the running shell. In drive A: you have
all the registered devices, drive B: shows the ROM contents. 
Devices are a small <em>key</em> devices, that handles the keyboard interface.
If opened for reading, it sends the keycode (0-63) of a pressed key.
The <em>null</em> device is a neverfilling trashcan. The <em>spooler</em>
device can serialize file transfers. 
Drive C: is the serial IEC bus drive 8, accessed as a VC1541.
<P>
As a program you have <em>irtx</em> on drive B:. It shows a small menu
to select a universum TV set, a Sony CD player or a Sony receiver (master).
It can then send infrared signals to (my) audio equipment :-)
<p> As the <em><font color="#ff0000">Gecko</font></em> has no MMU, all 
programs share the same memory. The following memory locations are used:
<pre>
Zeropage:
2-14		kernal zeropage
14-32		reserved
32-87		programs

Memory:
$100-$200	Stack
$200-$300	PCBUF (interprocess communications buffer)
$300-$800	kernel buffers, tables etc
$800-$1000	used program space (fsiec buffers, ...)	
</pre>
So in an 8 kByte system, you still have 4 kByte for your purposes.
It is recommended to start zeropage use at 128.

<hr>
<H3>OS/A65 <em><font color="#ff0000">Gecko</font></em> specifics</H3>

There are no changes to the OS/A65 kernel for the <em>Gecko</em> computer.
Though, because there is only one 6522, and no special IRQ timer, the following
must be considered:
<ul>
<li>The kernel needs an interrupt source to be able to preemptively schedule
processes. The <em>keydev</em> device uses the VIA timer2 to periodically
generate these interrupts. The device itself clears the interrupt again,
the kernel never touches the VIA.
<li>Both, the <em>fsiec</em> filesystem for the serial IEC bus and the 
<em>irtx</em> program need a timer, and only the VIA timer 1 is left. So
they both have to compete for this timer by getting semaphore <strong>SEM_T1</strong>,
which is an alias to SEM_SERIEC. This is a system semaphore to handle
concurring requests for system hardware.
</ul>

<h3>Advanced Hardware...</h3>
<p>
Ok, after toying around with that thing I was wondering if I could use the
memory and the I/O in a standard <a href="../index.html">CS/A65</a>
board. I came up with a simple solution with only some jumpers to switch 
in addition to removing the local CPU. So this board can be tested in a 
standard CS/A65 system.
