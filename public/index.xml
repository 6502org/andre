  <overview>
On these pages you will find quite some information concerning selfbuilt
8-bit computers of the 6502 line. Also some stuff for old Commodore
machines with this CPU is there, like new C64 kernals, VC1541 modifications
etc. A selfbuilt operating system
features Multitasking, dynamic memory management, a standard library
and internet access.
