  <overview>
	<p>
	Before knowing whether a system works as expected, you need to test it. This page describes the
	test setup (as is currently planned).
	</p><p>
	As the processor is implemented as VHDL, there are two test options - one is to implement it in a
	programmable logic device, but also simulating the VHDL directly on a PC. Both type of tests
	are (will be) described here.

	The VHDL implementation will be written compatible to the GHDL compiler of the GNU compiler collection.
	The GHDL compiler allows to simulate VHDL code. It also allows to link C-code to the VHDL code during
	the link process. Therefore the VHDL test cases will be controlled using code written in C, that allows
	to load test data input from files and use it for example as ROM content, 
	and compare VHDL simulation output with other test data also read
	from a file. This way test cases can easily be written, with test data as 65k executable code
	being provided as a file, and output comparable with pre-computed data.
