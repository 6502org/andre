<H1>How to add a 16550A UART to a 65xx system</H1>
<p>(C) 1997,2006 A. Fachat (Originally published in TCJ in 1997)</p>
<p>
I have now stumbled across quite some 6502 computers that use the
6551 ACIA for a serial interface. When I used this chip, I found 
it rather slow then. Especially as I was doing a Multitasking
operating system for the 6502, the interrupt latency became to large
to reliably catch each and every character from the device even
at 2400 Baud. This was even worse on the 1MHz my C64, into which I had built
an ACIA interface in a socket under the SID 6581 (sound chip).
</p><p>
I had already heard of the 'FIFO-serial interface' for PCs, and even 
replaced some 8250 with 16550A myself. So I decided to replace the 
ACIA in my C64 with the UART 16550A. 
</p>

<h2>Bus differences</h2>
<p>
The UART chips was designed for a different bus as the 6502, so there
are differences in how to handle the chip. When I had a first look 
at the interface I really wondered why they built the chip this way...
</p><p>
The Reset line is high active - which places the chip in "running mode"
at power up, and then only an explicit signal on the Reset line 
resets the chip. The 65xx series use an active low -RESET line, such
that even a simple RC-element with an additional Schmitt-Trigger suffices
for a simple computer. 
</p><p>
The UART Interrupt line is high active also. You can not wire-or it together
with other devices (brain-damaged PC design!) as in 65xx systems for example.
And of course, there is no general clock line, but accesses take place
during active RD/WR lines, as long as the chip is selected. The UART
has two read (RD and -RD) and write (WR and -WR) lines, where each 
triggers a data transfer (i.e. not (RD and -RD), but (RD or -RD) -- which
is IMHO quite peculiar, but I can think of uses for DMA, for example).
</p><p>
These differences in the bus system are, in my opinion, the reason that
many people still use the ACIA 6551, and not the much more sophisticated
UART 16550A. A more sophisticated chip involves more sophisticated
software. In contrary to the simple handling of an ACIA, the UART is
indeed more complicated to handle, which also seems a reason for its low
usage. In fact there are many caveats in the UART design that make the
thing terrible to program. See the Serial FAQ at
ftp://ftp.phil.uni-sb.de/pub/people/chris/The_Serial_Port for more
information.  But then the UART has the already mentioned advantage of
the FIFO, which makes it attractive.
</p>
<h2>Schematics</h2>
<p>
When I was rebuilding my ACIA interface to a UART interface, I had to reuse
some sockets and chips, because I didn't really want to build everything
from scratch (where I didn't have all the parts at home at that time anyway...)
</p><p>
The old Interface card was a daugtherboard to be put between the socket
for the C64 SID chip and the SID itself. An additional connector gave
three signals: A9 to divide the SID address space in half (although the
SID has only 28 registers, they are mirrored in a 1kByte block of I/O
space in the C64), -E to enable the ACIA at all and -IRQ to signal the
CPU. I soldered A9 and -IRQ to appropriate places on the C64
motherboard, while -E goes to a switch.
</p><p>
With the ACIA and the only use of a dual 2-to-4 decoder 74LS139 I was able
to do the whole thing. It even really made the ACIA disappear from the
memory map, when it was disabled.  This didn't work with the UART, because
I needed more circuitry from the decoder to manage the RD/WR handling.
Well, one could surely think of something cleaner, but I wanted it quick...
</p>
<h2>Here's how it works in the C64</h2>
<p>
All pins from the SID are connected from the C64 SID socket to the SID
socket on the daughterboard, except -CS (pin 8). This line is or'ed with
the additional A9, to remove the SID from the upper half of its memory
window, and then given to the SID. The first half of the '139 then gives
the condition that Phi2 is high, -CS is active, and A9 is high.  This
output is then fed into the -E pin of the second decoder.  The enable
line (from the external enable switch) switches between the two used and
the two not used outputs of the decoder. R/-W as the lower decoder
address line then switches between the RD and the WR line.  These
outputs are or'ed with the inverted Phi2, and fed to the UART.
</p><p>
This arrangements has two purposes: The two decoder stages that have Phi2
in the first decoder give a delay to the beginning of the access. This is
needed, as the C64 switches from video chip memory access to CPU memory
access with the phases of Phi2. So the address lines need some time to
adjust (The VIA 6522, for example, expects the address lines valid at the
beginning of Phi2, and doesn't work with the C64 that way. It needs the
starting transition of Phi2 to be delayed).  The ORing with the inverted
Phi2 then stops the access by invalidating the RD/WR lines when Phi2
becomes inactive. This also is a reason for Phi2 being used as CS line.
</p>
<h2>Another example</h2>
<p>
I have also built a Dual UART card with two 16550A for my selfbuilt 6502
computer, and there I used a similar approach.  I took a 74LS138, a
3-to-8 decoder. The select line for the I/O area goes to the decoder as
enable line (-E1), as well as Phi2 (E3).  -E2 is not used and set low.
A0 is connected to R/-W of the system, and A1 is another address line.
A2 is also set low. The outputs Q0-Q3 are then connected to the two
chips.
<pre>
-Q0 -> UART1 -WR, 
-Q1 -> UART1 -RD, 
-Q2 -> UART2 -WR, 
-Q3 -> UART2 -RD
</pre>
</p>
<h2>The Software</h2>
<p>
Now that you have the UART in your computer, you have to have some software
to use it. I have also rewritten the C64 OS to use the UART as serial
interface (which I had also done to use the ACIA before).
You can find it on my <a href="../cbmhw/kernal/index.html">kernal</a> page.
But I have already written a generic
UART device driver for my selfbuilt 6502 Operating System, OS/A65.
</p><p>
The code shown here is part of that driver, together with a simple
C64 binding. It actually follows the 
suggestions given in the "Serial FAQ" (being mentioned in TCJ#79 to be
at ftp://ftp.phil.uni-sb.de/pub/people/chris/The_Serial_Port but not
available anymore).
I have one problem, though. Because the interrupt generation is somehow
buggy in the UART, the FAQ suggests to start the transmitter from outside
the IRQ routine. Well, in my OS I don't have any device code outside the
IRQ routine (that is called when data is being sent). But then, as the
6502 cannot directly decide where an IRQ came from, the interrupt drivers 
are (almost) all called when an IRQ occurs, with "higher priority" first.
So the serial driver, being the one with the highest priority, is called
very often, even if it is not the source of the IRQ itself. But that ensures
that the IRQ routine is called and so I can check there, if I have to 
start transmission manually.
</p><p>
The listed program echos characters it receives from the serial line
back to the serial line. It also takes characters typed on the C64
and sends them to the serial line. A part of the screen is used as
character buffer, so that you can see something, when the program 
receives characters
</p><p>
I have written a SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol) program for my
selfwritten OS, that uses an UART. On my 1 MHz C64 with builtin UART it
replies to Internet PING messages without packet loss at 9600 baud. Using
the same program with an ACIA, even at 2400 baud, is completely useless
due to lost characters.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
The 16550A might not be the chip of choice for simple applications, where
a high data rate is not necessary. But if you don't want to use the serial
line as a terminal line only, but want to do some serious data transfer,
better take an UART. Here you see a way to use the UART in 6502 based
systems and how to program it.
