     <h3><a name="challenge" id="challenge">The challenge...</a></h3><p>As there are already 65816-based boards (like my <a href="../csa/cpu816v2/index.html">CS/A65 65816 board</a>) why should it be difficult to build a board to replace a 6502?
	Well, it's the timing! In my other 65816 board the actual system clock is derived from the
	65816 fast clock in a synchronous way. But in a 6502 replacement no such synchronous clock is
	available. There are two clock domains, the system domain that feeds the board with a 
	slow (1 MHz or 2 MHz for example) PHI0 clock - and the fast 65816 clock domain.
	These two need to be synchronized.
	</p><p>
	Unfortunately if two different clock domains interact, metastability can occur 
	(see wikipedia link below for example). I.e. a signal might not settle on a defined high 
	or low state for a considerable time when it is sampled directly during a transition 
	for example.
	</p><p>
	There are two ways around this issue:
	<ol>
	<li>synchronize the two clock domains such that clearly defined timing characteristics 
		between the clock domains apply, and no clock shift occurs. You could do this with
		a PLL (phase-locked loop) for example.</li>
	<li>use an arbiter between the two clock domains as a means of communication between the
		two domains. Arbiters are still subject to metastability but with a multi-stage approach
		the mean time between failures can be set in the range of years or more.</li>
	</ol>
	Lacking experience with a PLL, and not being sure how a PLL would react on changing base
	system frequencies - where the CPU to be replaced can already run on different frequencies -
	I decided to go for the arbiter approach.
	</p><ul><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability_in_electronics" target="_blank" class="extlink">Wikipedia on metastability in electronics</a> </li><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLL" target="_blank" class="extlink">Wikipedia on phase-locked loop</a> </li></ul><h3><a name="sync" id="sync">Clock Synchronization</a></h3><p>
	The clock synchronization has to happen on two places - from slow to fast and from fast to slow.
	Let's first look at the fast to slow transition. When the CPU outputs the correct addresses
	during an (initially) fast cycle, the CPLD logic detects a slow access and asserts the
	<code>isslow</code> signal. This is sampled on the rising edge of the CPU clock
	(which is in the fast domain at this time) to give the <code>slowdetected</code> signal.
	</p><p>
	The rising edge of the CPU clock is used as this is the time when CPU signals are guaranteed
	to be stable. There has to be some safety margin to account for propagation delays in the 
	CPLD <code>isslow</code> generation though. Therefore the PHI1 phase cannot be too fast.
	I found that it should be at least 50 ns. 
	</p><p>
	Once <code>slowdetected</code> is asserted, the CPU clock is held high to await the actual
	slow cycle. I.e. I don't use the CPU's RDY pin, but the 65816 feature that it can be stopped
	indefinitely with PHI2 high.
	</p><p>
	As the fast and slow clocks are not synchronized, the detection that a slow access should be
	done can be anywhere during the slow clock cycle. It could be during PHI1, PHI2 close to any
	of the transitions, anywhere. That's where the "arbiter" kicks in.
	</p><div class="rightimg">
                <a href="imgs/timing1.png"><img width="250px" src="imgs/timing1_small.png" /></a><br />General timing structure
                </div>
	<p>
	In this diagram you can see that the first slow access is detected at 2300 ns, in the
	middle of a slow cycle (PHI0/PHI2 high). The actual slow access thus has to wait for the next
	slow PHI1 cycle to actually start.
	</p><p>
	In the timing diagram you also see a signal called <code>phidelayed</code>. This plays a key role
	in the synchronization mechanism. This signal is the slow PHI0 input, but delayed for a certain
	amount of time (and OR'd with PHI0, see 2 MHz operation below). 
	The falling edge is important here. <code>phidelayed</code> is delayed such that the falling
	edge is far enough before the rising edge of PHI2 to allow for address bus setup times. 
	Therefore when <code>phidelayed</code>
	goes low, and a slow cycle is already detected, an actual slow cycle starts.
	</p><p>
	More concrete, when <code>slowdetected</code> is detected on a falling edge of 
	<code>phidelayed</code>, then <code>slowaccess</code> is asserted to actually start a slow
	cycle. To avoid any race condition (such as one signal derived from <code>slowdetected</code>
	having a different propagation delay than another and then only one of these being latched 
	at <code>phidelayed</code> going low), this signal is then used as "single point of thruth"
	signal to enable the slow bus (only if the slow access actually goes to the slow bus, and not to
	the board's RAM or ROM). These signals are then latched with <code>phidelayed2</code> going low
	which comes 20 ns after <code>phidelayed</code>. The <code>nslowbusclr</code>,
	<code>slowaddrlatch</code>, <code>nslowdataen</code> and <code>rnw</code> then determine the
	state of the slow bus (details see below).
	</p><p>
	After the slow access, when PHI2 goes low, a small pulse signal <code>startfast</code>
	is generated to then restart the fast access. This pulse actually enables the fast clock
	counter again (<code>divenable</code>) so that the fast clock starts with a fresh,
	PHI1 cycle (i.e. PHI2 low). In the diagram you can actually see that the next cycle
	is also detected as a slow cycle, but it is not detected as going to the original system bus.
	</p><h3><a name="jitter" id="jitter">Jitter</a></h3><p>
	As the two clock domains are not completely in sync, there is some jitter that appears
	between the slow domain signal (PHI2) and its fast clock domain counterpart 
	(<code>phidelayed</code>). I.e. the timing interval between PHI2 going low and 
	<code>phidelayed</code> going low is not constant, but changes in the range of a fast clock
	cylce, i.e. 20 ns. All other timing values must take this into account.
	</p><p>
	Also there is some jitter when the slow cycle ends. A PHI2 going low the <code>slowdone</code>
	signal is asserted. This signal is used to reset the <code>slowdetected</code> signal, so this
	goes low directly with PHI2 going low. This pulse must be long enough, so <code>startfast</code>
	that ends the <code>slowdone</code> pulse must be at least 10 ns, better as I use it
	20 ns after PHI2 goes low. <code>startfast</code> has some jitter, though. It is derived
	from the <code>phidelayed</code> shift register line, so it is subject to the same jitter
	as <code>phidelayed</code>.
	</p><h3><a name="origbus" id="origbus">Original bus access</a></h3><p>The CPLD control interface for the original bus consists of these signals:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>nslowbuslcr</code> - if low, set the address lines to zero (as long as CPU does not need the original bus</li>
		<li><code>slowaddrlatch</code> - on a rising edge of this signal the CPU address bus values are latched and put on the original system bus. Must be at least about 20 ns behind <code>nslowbusclr</code> going high, to allow the '273 ICs to recover and latch the correct address.</li>
		<li><code>nslowdataen</code> - if low, connect the CPU data bus with the system data bus</li>
		<li><code>rnw</code> - this is the system bus read/not write line. You cannot connect this directly to the CPU, so in the CPLD a circuit similar to the '273 is emulated for the read/not write line</li>
	</ul><p>
	The <code>startfast</code> signal is actually derived from two other signals, 
	<code>startfastr</code> and <code>startfastw</code>, one for read and the other one
	for write accesses. As this signal determines when the CPU continues with a new cycle,
	you could actually delay this differently for read and write cycles. Originally I thought
	that I need to delay further for write cycles to make the data bus hold time longer. 
	As the 65816 is very fast, that could be a problem so I anticipated that. During the tests,
	however, it showed that I had to delay the read access as well. That could have been 
	due to the way I then created the signals to clear and latch the slow address bus.
	As I have changed that I currently do not see any need to delay read cycles anymore.
	So there is still room for experimentation.
	</p><h3><a name="bugus" id="bugus">Bogus cycle elimination</a></h3><p>On quite some opcodes the 6502 CPU does memory accesses that are actually
	not used, so called bogus cycles. It does them when it needs time to internally compute
	an address value for example (e.g. when crossing page boundaries etc). The original 
	6502 has no way of telling the external system whether a cycle is valid or not.
	But the 65816 has such a way, using the <code>VPA</code> and <code>VDA</code> signals.
	Therefore is is possible to hide a bogus cycle from the original system. 
	Assume that the system is running in slow memory only. Normally the CPLD would
	detect the slow access on the next fast cylce (after the first PHI1 phase after
	the previous slow access), and wait for <code>phidelayed</code> going low to initiate
	a real slow cycle.
	</p><div class="rightimg">
                <a href="imgs/timing2.png"><img width="250px" src="imgs/timing2_small.png" /></a><br />Hiding bogus cycles
                </div>
	<p>
	but when the cpu access is not valid, there is no need to wait for the actual slow cycle.
	instead the cpu can continue with the fast cycle and then begin a new cycle.
	this new cycle is then (most of the times) a valid one. So when the complete invalid cycle
	plus the phi1 phase of the following valid cycle fit between phi2 going low and
	<code>phidelayed</code> going low, the slow system only sees two consecutive - valid - 
	cycles, and the invalid cycle is hidden!
	</p><p>
	You can actually see an invalid cycle being hidden in the diagram linked here. The CPLD
	builds the <code>validaddr</code> signal from <code>VDA</code> and <code>VPA</code>. When
	this signal goes low, the cycle is not valid, which happens shortly after time 45us in
	the diagram, where the red marker line is.
	</p><h3><a name="2mhz" id="2mhz">2 mhz operation</a></h3><p>
	To hide bogus cycles, the time interval between PHI2 going low and <code>phidelayed</code>
	going low must be long enough. Unfortunately, when the system is running at 2 MHz, this
	time interval is too long: there is not enough time between <code>phidelayed</code> going
	low (starting a slow access) to allow for the address setup times on the slow bus.
	In fact the falling edge of the <code>phidelayed</code> actually runs into the
	following PHI2 phase! That is actually why <code>phidelayed</code> is OR'd with PHI2, so
	that in this case the system does not hang.
	</p><p>
	That is where the <code>FASTMODE</code> clock register bits comes in. It is set by default
	and reduces the <code>phidelayed</code> delay such that the system actually works with 
	2 MHz. But there is a cost - you cannot hide bogus cycles anymore.
	</p><h3><a name="clocks" id="clocks">clock duty cycle</a></h3><p>
	Maybe you have already wondered how I actually get to a CPU clock frequency of
	10 MHz. There actually is a trick involved.
	</p><p>
	Why is this so difficult to achieve with a 50 MHz clock signal? Because the clock
	is divided by an odd value, 5. Going from frequencies to clock cycle lengths, going from
	50 MHz to 10 MHz means to go from a 20 ns clock cycle to 100 ns, i.e.
	5 times as much. But normally clock dividers work on a fixed transition on the input signal.
	I.e. when using 5 cycles of the input clock I would only be able to have something like
	2 cycles low and 3 cycles high. I had actually tried this by changing the clock latch value
	loaded into the clock counter by one depending on the clock state. The CPU would work with
	faster speeds (it's rated 14 MHz) so 40 ns low is ok, and the RAM would work
	with 60 ns ok.
	</p><p>
	However, as I have already written above, this did not leave enough time for the CPU 
	to put up the addresses <em>and</em> the CPLD to actually use the address for address decoding.
	What could I do? Here comes the trick. I delayed this asymmetric clock signal by 
	10 ns by using the opposite edge of the fast input clock, then AND'ed the two signals.
	Alas, a clock signal with 50 ns low and 50 ns high phase.
	</p><p>
	Admittedly this signal is out of specs for the static RAM chip I use, which is rated 55 ns
	access time. Using the burn-in test however, I found it still works. I might get me a faster
	RAM IC though.

                </div>
	<p>vhdl defines that logic is separated into modules. each module has input and
		output signals that define the "interface" of the module. in general you can think
		of these modules as being similar to logic ics. these ics resp. modules are then
		plugged together in higher level modules, using the input and output signals.
	</p><p>so i have separated the cpld logic into different modules as well, which i am going
		to explain here. the different modules and their structure is shown in the side image.
	</p>
     <h3><a name="core" id="core">pet816.vhd</a></h3><p>
	this module is the top level module. its input and output lines are the ones that are
	used on the cpld pins. it does not actually contain any logic. instead it only passes
	the signals to the core module. in addition to that it also defines the power-up values
	of the clock and control registers, that are passed to the core module. 
	</p><p>
	the power-up values for the registers are defined in this module, so that in a debug
	setting i can define different power-up values for the registers without changing the
	core module.
	</p><h3><a name="core" id="core">core.vhd</a></h3><p>
	the core module is the one that holds all the other parts together. its input and output
	signals are the ones for the cpld pins, but additionally contains the power-up values for
	the clock and control registers.
	</p><p>
	internally it wires all the other modules together. mostly it does this by
	wiring signals from one module to the other. only a few signals are created in
	the module itself. 
	</p><p>
	the two most important signals generated here are <code>isslow</code>, and <code>isorig</code>.
	the <code>isorig</code> signals goes true when the address selection signals from the 
	systemmap module (plus some control register values) indicate that the cpu access goes 
	to the slow system bus, using the 6502 bus interface to the base system.
	<code>isslow</code> goes active when a slow system access is detected using the cpu 
	signals - addresses, vpa/vda (in form of the <code>validaddr</code> signal), r/-w - control
	register bits and more. it is an asynchronous signal that appears when the cpu signals
	fulfill the appropriate conditions. it is then clocked in the clocksync module.
	</p><h3><a name="map" id="map">systemmap.vhd</a></h3><p>
	the systemmap generates signals for the different memory areas. it determines where
	in the memory map the i/o and the video memory areas are. it also determines where the
	mirror ram (for the lowest 64k) and the system mirror are. this is the only module
	that needs to be replaced for a different type of system (at least in theory).
	</p><h3><a name="div" id="div">clockdivider.vhd</a></h3><p>
	this module creates the main clock signals. it gets the 50mhz input clock and divides
	the clock signal by 2 (<code>divby2</code>), 
	as well as by the value given from the clock register. 
	the latter signal (<code>masterclk</code>) is then used to generate the 
	actual cpu clock. the clock divider has an enable input that resets the clock signal.
	this is used to restart the fast <code>masterclk</code> with a full phase 1 (phi1 high,
	phi2 low) after a slow access.
	</p><h3><a name="shift" id="shift">ClockShift.vhd</a></h3><p>
	The ClockShift module uses the <code>masterclk</code> and <code>divby2</code> signals
	to to delay the slow system clock by defined delay times. The resulting signals 
	<code>phidelayed</code>, <code>phidelayed2</code> and <code>fastr/fastw</code> are used
	to synchronize the CPU with the slow system clock.
	</p><h3><a name="sync" id="sync">ClockSync.vhd</a></h3><p>
	This module controls when the CPU is doing a slow memory access (be it orignal system bus, or
	on the board's fast bus - ROM or the SLOWCLK control register bit is set). 
	The <code>slowdetected</code> signal is the <code>isslow</code> signal clocked by the
	rising edge of the CPU clock and signals that the CPU waits for a slow memory access.
	When the correct timing allows to start a slow access, the signal <code>slowaccess</code>
	then enables the slow access cycle. The slow cycle is ended with the <code>startfast</code>
	input - which is generated in the Core module from the <code>fastr/fastw</code> shift 
	module outputs. But <code>startfast</code> is only effective when the system's RDY signal
	allows to end the cycle.
	</p><h3><a name="div" id="div">ControlRegister.vhd</a></h3><p>
	The control register module not only contains the control register, but also the
	clock register. Its input signals contain the power-up init register values, as passed
	from the PET816 module. Its output are the various control register values.
	Unfortunately the registers are only write-only at the moment
	</p><h3><a name="div" id="div">BoardMemSel.vhd</a></h3><p>
	This module creates the select lines for the onboard RAM and ROM ICs, including the 
	ROM's write-enable (for the programming).

	The main test setup module is the PET816 Test Bench (TB) module. It simulates the actual 
	system, i.e. it wires together the actual CPLD Core module with a 6502 CPU, some RAM
	and the external test parameter module. In the test bench the hardware of the 
	65816 board is simulated in a basic way. 
	For example the '273 address latches are emulated to simulate the correct system bus 
	address values (and therefore to read the correct data values e.g. from ROM).
	The test bench also contains the clock generators for the internal (50MHz) or system
	bus clock (1MHz or 2MHz depending on config option).
	</p><p>
	The outermost module is the actual test. It contains the test parameters and the test ROMs
	and feeds these values into the actual test bench. Test parameters are the initial
	register values for example. The ROM has a RESET vector, and contains NOP operations as
	default value. Only the code that is needed for the test is put into the emulated ROM.
	This way the only module that is specific to a certain test case is the outermost module
	and is actually implemented as a separate file for each test case.
	</p><h3><a name="testexec" id="testexec">Test Execution</a></h3><p>
	In my VHDL project setup, which is a Xilinx ISE Webpack project, I have a subdirectory called
	<code>testsuite</code>. In this directory I have created (in further subdirectories) the
	test bench and test case codes. The test bench as well as the free6502 CPU VHDL is in the 
	<code>src</code> subdirectory. The test cases are in the <code>testbench</code> directory.
	</p><p>
	The tests work in a Linux (should work on any Unix) environment and requires the 
	<code>make</code>, <code>ghdl</code> and <code>gtkwave</code> programs installed.
	<code>ghdl</code> is a VHDL simulator based on the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).
	<code>gtkwave</code> is a viewer to view the output of the <code>ghdl</code> simulation.
	The signal images shown above are made with this tool.
	</p><p>
	Running the tests is done by running
	<pre>
	make ctrl
	</pre>
	or 
	<pre>
	make hbog
	</pre>
	in the testsuite directory, to run the <code>ctrl</code> or <code>hbog</code> test cases 
	respectively.
	</p><h3><a name="testclock" id="testclock">Clock Testing</a></h3><p>As described above the synchronization of the two clock domains can lead to
	problems, and one common error here is to do testing only with synchronized test clock
	generators - that are synchronized and do not show real-world clock drift. 
	</p><p>
	Therefore I don't use an exact 50 MHz clock in the emulation, but drift about 1 ns
	per clock cycle. This allows me to scroll over some execution cycles and get a picture
	of whether there are problems in the clock synchronization.
	</p><h3><a name="testtiming" id="testtiming">Test Timing</a></h3><p>
	On the <code>ctrl</code> test case I ran into a problem when I started to actually
	gate the ROM output with the CPU clock. The CPU latches the data bus values
	at the falling edge of the CPU clock. In the simulation however, the ROM output
	was already set to open before the CPU gated the values, thus it did not work.
	</p><p>
	So here I started to work onto actually simulating delays with VHDL. In the testbench
	I created a new signal
	<pre>
	cpuclk_del &lt;= transport cpuclk after 5 ns;
	</pre>
	This code takes the <code>cpuclk</code> signal and delays it for 5 ns. Using
	this delayed clock signal to determine the CPU data input from the ROM output, 
	the VHDL simulation allows the CPU to latch the ROM data when its clock goes low
	and before ROM output goes into tri state:
	<pre>
        if (cpuclk_del = '0') then
             	-- RAM/ROM data switch off time
                core_data_in &lt;= transport "ZZZZZZZZ" after 5 ns;
        else
                if (cpuaddr(15 downto 12) &gt; "1000") then
                        -- ROM access time (from_data is without delay)
                        core_data_in &lt;= reject 10 ns inertial from_data after 70 ns;
                else
                        -- RAM access time (from_data is without delay)
                        core_data_in &lt;= reject 10 ns inertial fram_data_out after 50 ns;
                end if;
        end if;
	</pre>
	In this code there also is a the <code>reject/inertial/after</code> command.
	This construct allows to reject spikes in the signal, here a 10 ns spike will
	be ignored (the value after the <code>reject</code>). Then the signal is
	delayed by the time values after the <code>after</code> statement.
	</p><p>
	Please keep in mind that an <code>if</code> has an immediate response, i.e. there is no
	delay or inertial reject involved. If you want to delay the effect of an <code>if</code>
	statement, you have to create a delayed signal that you have to use in the <code>if</code>
	condition as I have done here with the <code>cpuclk_del</code> signal.
	</p><p>
	I have currently done only a very basic simulation. With more test cases (if necessary)
	I expect to get more accurate here and use more of the timing delays. 
	</p><p>
	As far as I understand the transport and inertial delays are ignored when doing the actual
	synthesis, but I haven't tried it so far, though.
