<h1>CRTC operation</h1><p class="copyright">(C)
1998-2010 Andr&eacute;  Fachat</p> 
<div class="overview">
<P>The 6545/6845 Cathode Ray Tube Controller (CRTC) is a flexible
video chip. It has been used in the Commodore PET computers,
and even early PC graphics cards.
</P>
<P>
For the operation of the video interface Commodore introduced the
Cathode Ray Tube Controller (CRTC) 6545 with the third type of boards.
This controller is very flexible, programmable and provides all
necessary interface signals for the video hardware.
</P>
<P>I have made a collection of test programs and timing
examples for the CRTC in my CBM 8296. You can download the whole
suite, including a (derived) diagram of the CRTC internals from the CBM archive
as
<A HREF="http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/pet/programming/index.html">crtctest-1.1.tar.gz</A>.
It also includes a summary of the differences of the various
CRTC models.
You can have a look at some of the weird screen distortions in
the <A HREF="pet/index.html">test program documentation</A>, and an
overview over the derived CRTC internals on
<A HREF="internals/index.html">this page</A>
(all from the crtctest archive).
</P><P>A sample schematic can be found on the
<A HREF="http://www.6502.org/users/andre/csa/">CS/A65</A>
computer page or in the PET schematics on the
<A HREF="../../petindex/links.html">links page</A> of the PET index.

<P>
The CRTC has a bus interface compatible to the 6502 bus system,
using only two addresses.
</P><P>
The first address doubles as address register when writing and as 
status register when reading. I.e. reading the status register at
address 0 gives the internal status of the CRTC as described below.
Writing to the address register at address 0 links the value register
at address 1 to the corresponding register in the internal register file.
</P><P>
Writing the index number of the internal CRTC register file to the
address register provides access to the corresponding register
in the register file. I.e. to write #13 to register #6 you have to
store 13 to the address register and then 6 to the value register.
This procedure is the same for all registers (except of course the status
register).
Therefore all mentionings of "register" (except for the status) 
will in the following
denote internal CRTC register numbers, the value you write to the
address register.
</P>
<P>The video interface consists of the Memory Address lines MA0-13,
the Row Address lines RA0-4, Display Enable DE, Cursor Enable CE,
and Vertical and Horizontal Sync outputs. Only inputs are the /RESET
line that clears all counters (providing a sort of synchronisation
method), the Light Pen Strobe and the Character Clock CCLK.
</P>
<P>
There are several modes of operation for the CRTC available, but I
will only go into the most common one, which is also used in the
PET line of computers, the normal non-interlaced
sync mode.
</P>
    <h3><a name="sr">Status Register</a></h3>
	The status register can be read by the CPU at CRTC address 0
	and is thus not part of the internal CRTC register file
	but can be read by the CPU at any time.
<PRE>
Bit     Description
----------------------------------
 7      UR - Update ready (Rockwell R6545 only)
          0     Register 31 has been either read or written by the CPU
          1     an update strobe has occured
 6      LRF - LPEN Register Full 
          0     Register 16 or 17 has been read by the CPU
          1     LPEN strobe has occured
 5      VRT - Vertical retrace 
          0     Scan is currently not in the vertical blanking position
          1     [MOS6545] Scan is currently in its vertical blanking time 
          1     [R6545] Scan is currently in its vertical re-trace time.
                   Note: this bit goes to a 1 one when vertical re-trace starts.
                   It goes to a 0 five character clock times before vertical
                   re-trace ends to ensure that critical timings for refresh
                   RAM operations are met.
</PRE>
Please note that the UR is not available on all models, and VRT bit is handled 
differently by different models. 
	<h3><a name="registers">Register File</a></h3><p>
	The registers are written to (only some can be read) by writing the register number
	to the CRTC address (+0) and write (resp. read) the value to (from) CRTC address plus 1.
	</p><p>
        The registers are basically the same for all chips (see the <a href="diffs.html">Diffs page</a>):
	</p>
        <pre>
R0      Horizontal Total (-1)
R1      Horizontal Display
R2      Horizontal Sync position [1]
R3      Horizontal Sync Width [4]

R4      Vertical total character lines (-1) (7 bit)
R5      Vertical total adjust rasterlines (5 bit)
R6      Vertical displayed character lines (7 bit)
R7      Vertical Sync position (7 bit) [1]

R8      Mode control [4]

R9      Number of rasterlines per characterline (-1) [2]

R10     Cursor start rasterline + cursor mode control (5+2 bit)
R11     Cursor end rasterline (5 bit)
R12     Display start address high (6 bit) [3]
R13     Display start address low (8 bit) [3]
R14     Cursor address high (6 bit)
R15     Cursor address low (8 bit)
R16     Lightpen address high (6 bit)
R17     Lightpen address low (8 bit)

[1] Motorola states that "(Set data) = (Designated Data) - 1",
    as it is known for R0, R4, and R9
[2] Commodore does not mention the "-1"
[3] It is possible to read R12 and R13 on Motorola CRTCs only.
    All others can only read R14-R17.
[4] Horizonal width and mode control are different from
    model to model (e.g. 6545 vs. 6845.)
        </pre>
        Reading unused bits where possible reads a "0", which is, however, only explicitly stated in the Commodore docs.
    <h3><a name="horizontal">Horizontal Timing</a></h3>
<P>
The word <EM>Line</EM> in a video context can have two meanings: The
line of characters being displayed as text or a rasterline.
A rasterline is a horizontal line of pixels that can either be
black or white (or on or off, or in newer systems have <EM>one</EM>
color). A character line consists of several rasterlines, i.e. all
characters in one line have the same height.
</P><P>
The horizontal (line-) timing is determined by the character clock
(that defines the length of one character and in which all line
timing is measured) and the following registers:</P>
<PRE>
R0   Horizontal Total Reg.           total length of line (displayed
                                     and non-displayed cycles (retrace)
                                     in CCLK cylces minus 1
R1   Horizontal Displayed Reg.       number of characters displayed in a
                                     line 
R2   Horizontal Sync Position Reg.   The position of the horizontal sync
                                     pulse start in distance from line
                                     start
R3   Sync Width Reg. (Bits 0-3)      The width of the horizontal sync
                                     pulse in CCLK cycles (0 means 16)
</PRE>
<P>
This allows a very flexible rasterline timing .
Changing the value of R2 (Sync Position) shifts
the video image to the left or right. Here is an example of the line
timing (assuming a fictional 40 column line):
</P>
<PRE>

CCLK cycle #   0000000000111111 .... 3333344444444445555555555
               0123456789012345 .... 5678901234567890123456789

HSync          __________________  ____________|       |______

                                               &lt;-------&gt; R3 = 8
                                               ^
                                                R2 = 45
</PRE>
<P>
During the scanline the MA0-13 address lines present the CRTC memory
address of each character displayed, i.e. in the first CCLK cycle
the memory address of the start of the line is presented, and for
each following CCLK cycle the MA0-13 address lines are increased
by one. Memory addresses are only valid, to be displayed addresses
when the Display Enable signal is active (high).
</P><h3><a name="charline">Character Line Timing</a></h3>
<P>
A character line consists of a number of scanlines.
</P>
<PRE>
R9   Maximum Scan Line Address Reg.  Number of scanlines per character
                                     minus 1
</PRE>
<P>
As each scanline of one single character line should read the
character value from the same position in memory, the address
shown on the MA0-13 lines repeat each other for each scanline.
Therefore the same memory location is being read.
</P><P>
To display different lines on screen the Row Address lines RA0-4
are used. They give the number of the scanline within the current
character line. Thus by selecting a different character to raster
translation with the RA0-4 lines the correct raster will be displayed
for each rasterline of a character line.
</P>
<PRE>
rasterline  RA0-4  MA0-13
----------  -----  ------
   0         0       0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...

</PRE>
<P>
After each character line the start of line character memory address
is increased by the value of R1, Horizontal Total Displayed.
For the first character the start of line character memory address
is loaded from
</P>
<PRE>
R12  Start Address Reg. H (bit 0-5)  Bits 8-13 of the start of display
                                     memory address
R13  Start Address Reg. L            Bits 0-7 of the start of display
                                     memory address
</PRE>
<h3><a name="vertical">Vertical Timing</a></h3>
<P>
To control the vertical timing there are other registers
</P>
<PRE>
R4   Vertical Total Register         The number of character lines
                                     of the screen minus 1
R5   Vertical Total Adjust Reg.      The additional number of scanlines
                                     to complete a screen
R6   Vertical Displayed Reg.         Number character lines that are
                                     displayed
R7   Vertical Sync Position Reg.     Position of the vertical sync pulse
                                     in character lines.
R3   Sync Width Reg (Bits 4-7)       length of vertical sync pulse in
                                     times of a rasterline
</PRE>
<P>
Those registers make up a similar timing as the horizontal timing.
In the offscreen area (i.e. character line beyond R6) the Display
Enable signal is set inactive all the time.
Only R5 still needs to be explained. To allow a finer adjustment of the
screen length than by the number of character lines (R4), R5 adds
a number of blank scanlines at the end of the screen timing.
</P>
<P>
After the number of rasterlines (as given by R4 and R5) is displayed
all counters are reset, the start of line character memory address
is reset to the value of R12/R13 and the whole thing starts again.
</P>
      <h3><a name="cursor">Cursor Control</a></h3>
<P>
The CRTC can generate a hardware cursor signal
</P>
<PRE>
R14  Cursor Reg. H                   Bits 8-13 of the memory address
                                     where Cursor Enable should be
                                     active
R15  Cursor Reg. L                   Bits 0-7 of the Cursor Enable

R11  Crusor End Reg.                 Bits 0-4 last scanline of cursor
</PRE>
<P>
The Cursor Enable signal (CE) is active when the memory address
lines MA0-13 match the number set in R14/R15, and the scanline of the
character is in the range of R10/R11 and a valid active cursor
mode is selected.
</P>
      </div></div><div class="h2"><div class="h2h"><div class="h2t">&nbsp;</div><h2><a name="opmodes">Different Modes of Operation</a></h2></div><div class="h2c">
        The following sections explain the different modes of operation
        of the different models.
    <ul><li><strong><a name="rowcol">Straight binary vs. row/column addressing</a></strong>
        <p>
        The memory address counter can be set to two different modes. In the "straight binary" mode the counter is a normal 14 bit binary counter. The characters displayed on screen are taken from a consecutive area when MA0-MA13 are used as memory address.
        </p><p>
In row/column mode MA0-MA7 dubs as the column counter CC0-CC7 and presents the value of the character counter for each rasterline. MA8-MA13 dub as row counter CR0-CR5 and present the number of the current characterline.
        </p><p>
        This means that in row/column addressing mode each rasterline is
        a power of two long, in general
        256 bytes (or less, depending on how many address bits are used).
        </p>
        </li><li><strong><a name="interlace">Interlace and Video modes (All but Commodore)</a></strong>
        <p>
In the interlace mode the vertical sync signal is alternately delayed or not delayed for half of a rasterline time. This results in that every even-numbered frame is slightly shifted up or down as compared to the odd-numbered frame. This allows to fill up the double number of rasterlines, where two rasterlines always have the same content. The total frame time would then be double the "normal" CRTC frame time, as the second CRTC frame is used to fill the rasterlines "in between". So two identical CRTC frames, slightly shifted, make up a full frame on the display.
        </p><p>
This is different in the "interlace &amp; video" mode. Here the rasterline counter for each char increases by two. Thus in the first of the two interlaced CRTC frames the even rasterlines are drawn and in the second the odd ones. This effectively doubles the vertical resolution of the monitor: One character still is e.g. 8 rasterlines high, but the even 4 rasterlines are drawn in the first frame, and the odd 4 rasterlines in the second.
There are certain restrictions on the register values for interlace and interlace &amp; video mode, please refer to the Motorola documentation. The most important is that the vertical display register (R6) must hold half the number of displayed characterlines.

        <p>
This mode is set with R8 bit 3. Writing a 0 sets the shared adressing mode. In this mode the CRTC assumes that the CPU has an independent means of accessing the video memory - sharing the memory. A very common method is to switch the memory addresses from CRTC during Phi2/E low to CPU during Phi2/E high.
        </p><p>
More interesting is the transparent mode that is set with R8, bit 3=1. In this case the CPU cannot directly access the video RAM. The CRTC has to generate the address for the CPU. This is done via the write-only registers

R18     Update Register high (6 bit)
R19     Update Register low (8 bit)
        </pre>
        <p>
When R8 bit 7=1 then the CRTC puts the display memory address on MA0-13 during Phi2/E low, and the update address from R18/R19 during Phi2/E high, mimicking interleaved CPU access [I would assume this to be quite difficult if CCLK is not connected to Phi2/E]. In this mode it can be assumed that the CPU hardware knows when to access the memory. When R8 bit 7=0, then the CRTC waits for the horizontal and vertical retrace times to put the update address from R18/R19 on the address lines MA0-13. With R8 bit 6=1 pin 34 can be programmed to give a high pulse when the update address is valid. External latches might be necessary to store the data between initiating the access and receiving it.
        </p><p>
The CRTC docs do not say anything about the read/write control, so this has to be set up with external hardware.
        </p><p>
After each update access the address in the update register is incremented by 1. How does the CRTC know when an update has to be done? Status register bit 7 gives the answer. Reading or writing the - otherwise nonexisting - register R31 tells the CRTC to perform an update.
        </p><p>
Interestingly the Commodore 8563 VDC chip used in the C128 computer seems to be a direct descendant of the CRTC. The first 20 registers (with the exception of the mode register, R8) are the same as the Rockwell 6545 registers. Specifically the VDC only allows the transparent addressing. Therefore even R31 is kept - here the data to be transferred to/from the video memory must be written to/read from. Because this access is horribly slow, the VDC can also do copy operations in the video RAM by itself.

<P>
The following table shows some timing examples for the PET CRTC
as well as for a selfbuilt 6502 computer (CS/A65) with a 6545 CRTC.
[Note that the CS/A65 values have been derived by my humble self to interface
my <A HREF="http://www.6502.org/users/andre/csa/index.html">CS/A65</A> computer to a
normal german (PAL, 50Hz) TV set. I derived them by starting from
some guessed values and then trial and error until the TV set sync'd...]
Remember that even for 80 columns the PET use a CCLK of 1 MHz and
double the characters by hardware (i.e. writing 40 to R1).
Interestingly enough the CS/A65 parameter that have been found by
trial and error match the 8032 values quite well.

<P>The PAL TV values I have derived from the PAL timing standard - 64us per rasterline, 
	313 rasterlines per half-screen (which is simply repeated with the PET). As you
	can see the 8032 values for the 50Hz PET are PAL signal standards. You
	should thus be able to create valid PAL TV composite video signals from the user port (which carries
	the necessary HORZ DRIVE, VERT DRIVE and VIDEO signals - you'd need the 5V VCC from the
	tape drive connector though).
