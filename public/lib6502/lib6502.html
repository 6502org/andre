<P>This document consists of three parts, the <A HREF="#intro">Introduction</A>,
the actual <A HREF="#def">library interface definition</A> and the <A HREF="#impnotes">Implementation
Notes</A>. There also is an <A HREF="#index">Index</A> of the used function
names, as well as a section for <A HREF="#ideas">ideas</A> for the development.
Also <A HREF="#ack">acknowledgements</A> are given. </P>

<H3><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H3>

<P>This file has been written to define a certain compatibility level between
different operating systems for 6502 computer. It defines, on a more abstract
level that can be fitted to different real OSes, an interface for system
services. The goal of this definition is, to be able to fit into various
different environments, like </P>

<UL>
<LI>Computers like the C64 or the Gecko computer, with a single 6502, without
advanced memory management.</LI>

<LI>Computers like the C128, with a more enhanced memory management (two
banks with 64kByte each, relocatable zeropage and stack)</LI>

<LI>The CS/A65 computer, with a 6502 and a fully virtualized address management.</LI>

<LI>Computers with the 65816 CPU, for programs running in 8 bit emulation
mode.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The possible operating systems also differ in style and features: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Single-tasking OSes, like the ones provided with the C64, or other
6502 computers (if interprocess communication and process management calls
are not used, lib6502 programs can even run on such a machine).</LI>

<LI>'Monolithic' multitasking systems, that have all system services in
the kerne</LI>

<LI>Microkernel based OSes, that communicate with system servers via kernel
communication paths, providing this functionality to the program via the
lib6502.</LI>
</UL>

<P>This interface offers a common level for all these scenarios. Programs
written for this library can run on any of these platforms, a simple recompile
on the proprietary 6502 assembler/compiler will be enough. If people can
agree on a standard file format, not even recompiling might be necessary.
</P>

<P>In this library there still is a certain degree of freedom in the implementation.
System process IDs can still be 8 bit, as long as the library offers a
16 bit interface to the application. Memory allocation can still be pagewise
(in 256 byte blocks), as long as an application does not rely on that -
in other OSes it can probably allocate smaller chunks. The purpose of this
interface is, to hide the system OS behind. The application, on the other
hand, should never assume any implementation specifics, that are not documented
in this definition. </P>

<P>Most of the calls are modeled along the standard libc C library, but
there also are some calls from the Unix world. </P>

<P>This file does not make any assumptions about the implementation of
the calls, although the behaviour is (i.e. should be :-) noted as exactly
as possible.

<H4><A NAME="file">File interface</A></H4>

<P>The file interface uses file numbers. These file numbers are valid in
the local environment, and need not be globally valid. But the lib6502
always has to accept these numbers, and then tranforms them internally
wo whatever appropriate for the given OS. Of course an implementation where
both are identical should be better in performance. </P>

<P>file-nrs in lib6502 are treated as uni-directional or bi-directional
channels, i.e. an application can either read or write to a provided uni-directional
file-nr, and both at a time to a bi-directional file-nr. The OS can provide
bi-directional (with read/write operations possible on the same file-descriptor
in one task) or uni-directional (where a write to one end can be read from
the other end even in the same task.) file-descriptors. Only the latter
case is difficult. The stdlib must check the fileno and remap it to different
filenos for reading or writing. <!--
	In the former
	case, open on a R/W file would return two identical file-nrs,
	while pipe must return two different ones. In the latter case,
	it must be vice versa: open returning two different file-nrs,
	while pipe returns a single file-nr for reading and writing.
	This leaves the flexibility for the implementation.
--></P>

<P>When an application is started, three uni-directional file-nrs do already
exist and are open: STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR. STDOUT gives the file-nr
for writing task output, STDERR is for error output, while STDIN is for
reading program input. </P>

<P>All open files are closed when the process terminates. </P>

</PRE>

<P>Files are named as: &quot;Device:directory/filename&quot;, where Device
depends on the OS. There might be OSes where it's a single character (like
A: or 8:), others might have a real name. The lib needs to be able to parse
its own, implementation dependent namespace only. And the application should
not assume anything about the length of the device name. Directory separator
is &quot;/&quot;. Escape sequence for the directory separator is &quot;\/&quot;.
For the filename interpretation see the beginning of the <A HREF="#dir">directory</A>
section. Character set is ASCII (i.e. all codes between 0x20 and 0x7f must
be useable, others are not allowed). </P>

<P>The filesystem might imply other limitations on filename length, if
there are directories at all, or the allowed characters. Wildcards are
&quot;*&quot; that match any string and &quot;?&quot; that match exacly
one character. The interpretation might depend on the filesystem, i.e.
may not even be the same on the same system, but on different devices.
Escape sequences are &quot;\*&quot; and &quot;\?&quot;. Escape sequence
for &quot;\&quot; is &quot;\\&quot;. </P>

<P>The mode byte can be one of the abovementioned, which map to </P>

                OPEN_RW         2
                OPEN_AP         3
</PRE>

<P>Append means, that before any write to the file, the file pointer is
positioned at the end of the file. The mode can be or'd with some other
bits, like </P>

                OPEN_EXCL       $40     Only one process may have this file

</PRE>

<P>fgetc and fread, and fputc and fwrite can be used interchangeably. fread/fwrite
don't guarantee that the whole buffer is really read/written, even with
carry set. For this, see <A HREF="#f_fcntl">fcntl</A> below. 
If <code>fread</code> returns an <code>E_EOF</code> there can still be bytes that
have been read during this call, so the returned struct has to be checked.
</P>
<P>When opening
a file read-write, then when changing between read and write, there always
has to be an fseek operation. </P>

<P>There are, however, files that cannot be seeked, namely character devices.
If trying to use fseek on such a device, E_NOSEEK is returned. If a seekable
file is given to STDIN <strong>and</strong> STDOUT/STDERR, the behaviour is not defined.
Only non-seekable files should be given to STDIN and STDOUT/STDERR, when
opened read-write. </P>

<PRE>    <A NAME="f_pipe">pipe</A>        
                -&gt; x = file-nr for reading
                   y = file-nr for writing

                opens a uni-directional pipe with two file numbers,
                one for writing, and one for reading. To close the pipe,
                each end has to be closed separately.

    <A NAME="f_flock">flock</A>

                                                E_LOCKED
</PRE>

<P>The flock call locks a file for other tasks access. If locked shared,
then other tasks may also aquire shared locks - for reading, for example.
An exclusive lock can only be aquired by exactly one task at a time - for
writing. An exclusive lock can not be obtained when there are other shared
locks, but a pending exclusive lock blocks all other attempts to lock it,
even for shared locks. The flock implementation should be fair, i.e. lock
attempts are served in the order they arrive, except that exclusive get
served before shared locks. The flock call is optional. If not implemented,
return E_NOTIMP </P>

in most of the systems, except for RCHECK/WCHECK calls of course. </P>

<P>This call replaces a stdio file-nr (the pre-defined STDIN, STDOUT, and
STDERR file-nrs) with a new file-nr. The old file-nr must not be closed,
as it is when the process terminates. Instead the new file-nr returned

</PRE>

<P>This call 'reopens' a file, i.e. it returns a new file-nr that is used
as the old one. They share the same read/write pointers etc. Both file-nrs
must be closed. This way the same file can be given to STDOUT and STDERR
in a fork call, for example. </P>

<P><!---
<h4> <a name="rwnote">Note on read-write file-nrs</a></h4>

	Now should any file-nr
	as used in this lib be read-only or write-only?
	Systems with read-write OS file descriptors should then 
	probably return write file-nrs with an offset, to move them
	out of the OSes valid file-nr range. So they can be relatively
	easily handled.
<p>
	Otherwise it is necessary to complicate calls like close or
	dup. But then, how does fseek now work?
<p>
	I could move the read-write files out of OS range, or check
	them separately in other ways. Close would then close
	both sides, and dup would also dup both sides.
	When using a read-write file for one side of stdio, 
	the other half of the communication channel would 
	be left unused, however, which is a resource waste.
<p>
	Probably the second version (file-nrs uni- and bi-directional)
	should be taken for the final lib definition, what do you think?

<P>The library maintains a path that is used for each file system operation.
If a filename does not start with a &quot;/&quot; and not with a drive,
the path is put in front of the filename. If the filename starts with a
drive, it is always taken as an absolute filename, even if the &quot;/&quot;
is missing. If only the drive is missing, it is taken from the path. </P>

<P>A special case is the directory call with a filename as &quot;*:&quot;.
It does not use the path, but returns, in each entry, an available device
name. The length attribute should give the available amount of storage
space on the device. A wildcard in the device field is not allowed otherwise.
</P>

                       blocks until read, otherwise use fcntl(FC_RCHECK)

                reads _one_ directory entry into the buffer, which is
                of length (FD_NAME + MAX_FILENAME)
                One entry consists of a directory struct

                .word   0               ; valid bits
		.word	0		; owner ID
		.word	0		; group ID
                .word   0               ; permissions (drwxrwxrwx) (2 byte)
                .word   0,0             ; file length in byte (4 byte)
                .byt    0,0,0,0,0,0     ; last modification date
                                        ; (year-1990, month, day, hr, min, sec)

                The valid bit say, which entry in the struct is valid.
                bit 0 is for the permissions, bit 1 for the file length, bit 2
                for the date. The file length, if not zero, is an 
                approximate value (like the blocks *254 in a vc1541)
                this struct is followed by the null-terminated filename.
		The valid bits are:

		FDV_PERM	1
		FDV_LENGTH	2
		FDV_MDATE	4
		FDV_OWNER	8
		FDV_GROUP	16

		If permissions are valid, but not group/owner, then 
		the permissions for user and group are invalid, and the 
		permissions for others should be taken.

		The directory entry struct definitions are:

		FD_VALID	0	/* 1 byte */
		FD_PERM		1	/* 2 byte */
		FD_LENGTH	3	/* 4 byte */
		FD_MDATE	7	/* 6 byte */
		FD_NAME		13	/* null-terminated */

		The permission bits are actually a copy from the Linux
		man pages...:

		S_IFMFREE	$5000	/* free are on media */
		S_IFMSIZE	$7000	/* media size */

		Most of the file types are probably not implemented
		on a 6502 system. But before defining new types, one
		should keep the already defined values save.
		That's for the last three entries, which are not 
		Posix standards.

		The length field can be an approximate if it is not zero
		and the length is not valid (For VC1541 block lengths).

                This tries to fill in the bits that are _not_ valid in a
                dir struct. For example, if freaddir returned
                the filelength only, but no permissions, then calling
                fgetattr should get the file permissions.
                But it is not guaranteed, that all fields are filled,
                as some are not implemented on a certain filesystem.
                So even after fgetattr, a check of the valid bits is needed.
                The filename must be completed with the device and path.

<P>connect is something like Unix socket() and connect() together. listen
is something like socket(), bind() and listen() together. listen tells
the network layer, that the application is going to accept connections
on a certain port. Therefore, when a connection is requested from remote,
the network layer can accept them already and hold them &quot;on line&quot;
until the task gets the connection with accept. The maxmimum number of
acceptable connections is implementation specific.<BR>
accept gets the first connection waiting for an accept. the other sides
IP and port are stored in the buffer given in a/y If a connection is refused
after checking IP or port, the 'accepted' connection should be closed immediately.

                The file-nrs given for STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR share the same
                read/write pointers as the ones in this process.
                They are internally 'duped', and the calling task has to

<P>STDIN/STDOUT and STDERR file-nrs appear to be opened before process

waiting for a certain condition, it might call <code>yield</code> to give
other tasks the opportunity to run. <em>It is not necessary to call 
<code>yield</code> at all!</em> The scheduler interrupts any thread and 
takes control back when the thread has used its timeslice. But if the thread
knows that it waits for something to be done by another task, instead
of waiting for the end of its timeslice it can call yield to give other tasks
the immediate opportunity to run.

                This calls tries to allocate a 'named' semaphore.
                If the name already exists, the associated semaphore number
                is returned. If the name doesn't exist, and x=0, then an
                error is returned. If a name doesn't exist, and x=1, then
                the new name is allocated, a semaphore is allocated and
                associated with the name.

                &lt;- c = 1: a/y = name of semaphore
                -&gt; c = 0: ok
                   c = 1: a = error code        E_NOTIMP
                                                E_NOTFOUND
                The named semaphore is de-allocated. The named semaphore
                handler counts the number of allocations and frees a semphore
                if the name is totally deallocated.

                With this call, one can system-independently allocate
                system and hardware resources, if they are protected by 
                semaphores. 
                predefined semaphore names are:

                   c = 1: a = error code        E_NOSEM
                Pass operation on a semaphore. Locks the semaphore.

    <A NAME="f_vsem">vsem</A>        
                &lt;- x = semaphore number

</PRE>

<P><!--
	All semaphores held by the process are freed when it terminates.
	In general, positive semaphore numbers are lib stuff, negative
	numbers are system stuff.

<H5>Signals</H5>

<P>Signals are some kind of 'remote procedure call' - a signal handler
for a certain signal is called upon another threads' request. </P>

<PRE>    <A NAME="f_signal">signal</A>      
                &lt;- x = signal-number

                   c = 1: a = error code        E_NOTIMP
                                                E_ILLSIG
                installs a signal handler for a signal
                signal handler address NULL de-installs a handler.

    <A NAME="f_sendsignal">sendsignal</A>  
                &lt;- a/y pid of receiving process
                   x = signal number

                   c = 1: a = error code        E_ILLPID
                                                E_ILLSIG
                sends a signal to another process. A signal is an emulated
                interrupt to the address specified as the signal handler
                address.
</PRE>

<P>Allowed signals are </P>

<PRE>                SIG_USR1
                SIG_USR2
                SIG_USR3
                SIG_USR4
		SIG_CHLD
</PRE>

<P>The signal handler gets the signal mask for the signal in ac
(They may or may not be combined if the same signal handler is used for
more than one signal type). <BR>
A <code>SIG_CHLD</code> is used to get information about child processes
that died. If it is received, the
xr/yr registers holds the PID of the dead child and ac holds the return 
code of the child. Only child processes are registered that died when the 
signal handler mask was set. You can only receive, but not send a 
<code>SIG_CHLD</code>.
</P>

<H5>Send/Receive</H5>

<P>This section is very preliminary, as the SEND/RECEIVE interface in OS/A65
is not really useable without MMU, and Lunix doesn't have SEND/RECEIVE.

                The data is stored in the buffer, and length_of_data is
                changed to the length actually received. If the buffer
                is too short, length_of_data is set to the length needed,
                and E_NOMEM is returned.

<H4><A NAME="env">Environment Handling</A></H4>

The process environment is a table of strings handled by the lib6502
on a per-task basis. When a task forks a new task, the environment
is inherited by the new task. Strings here are null-terminated ASCII 
character arrays.

<PRE>
    <A NAME="f_getenv">getenv</A>: 
                &lt;- a/y name of env. variable
                -&gt; a/y = address of value or NULL if not set. 

    <A NAME="f_putenv">putenv</A>: 
                &lt;- a/y addr of &quot;name=string&quot; 
		-&gt; c=0: ok
		   c=1: error			E_NOMEM
						E_NOTIMP
		add or change env var. If the variable is empty, it is
		unset and will return either a NULL pointer with getenv
		or a pointer to an empty string.

    <A NAME="f_getenvp">getenvp</A>: 
                -&gt; a/y addr of null-terminated list of null-terminated
                strings with "varname=value" in each string, describing
                all environment variables. It is <strong>NOT</strong> allowed
                to change these variables 'by hand'.

    <A NAME="f_getos">getos</A>:
                -&gt; a/y addr of operating system string
</PRE>
<P>
The operating system string is a string containing the
<ul>
<li>operating system name (OS/A65)
<li>operating system version (2.0.0)
<li>CPU type (6510)
<li>architecture type (C64)
<li>library type (lib6502)
<li>library version (0.6)
</ul>
separated by spaces and ended by a nullbyte.
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="impnotes">Implementation Notes</A></H3>

<P>Implementation notes are currently available for the <A HREF="#imp_o65">o65</A>
file format only. This file format is rather flexible, and some of the
ideas can be taken for other lib6502 file formats. </P>

<H4><A NAME="imp_o65">o65 file format</A></H4>

<P>The o65 file format is defined in another file format specification.
It allows the use of undefined references. In order to simplify the relocation
procedure, lib6502 files have one undefined reference, namely &quot;STDLIB&quot;.
This reference defines the base of the lib6502 jump table. At STDLIB+0
there is a JMP opcode pointing to the code for fopen. At STDLIB+3 is a
JMP opcode pointing to the code for fclose etc. The order is determined
by the order given in the index of this definition. </P>

<P>A global variable is the &quot;main&quot; address, which is the start
address for any lib6502 executable. If the &quot;main&quot; address is
not given in the object file as a global variable, the start of the text
segment is assumed to be the &quot;main&quot; address. </P>

<P>The lib6502 file format allows the use of &quot;header options&quot;,
where some OS specific options may be saved. The lib6502 files can - but
don't need to - use a lib6502 header option (as defined in the o65 file
format specification). This lib6502 header option contains the following
struct: </P>

<PRE>        .byt lib6502_major_version_nr, lib6502_minor_version_number
        .byt lib6502_needed_level, lib6502_possible_level
</PRE>

<P>The version numbers are hints as to which library version the file is
compiled with. The level is a new number that describes which functions
are used, and which are not. A library may provide a certain amount of
lib calls in the library call table (STDLIB). The maximum number of calls
used is given in the &quot;possible_level&quot; value. The maximum number
that must be functional (and with only few exceptions not just return &quot;E_NOTIMP&quot;)
is given by the &quot;needed_level&quot; number. </P>

<P>The level numbers are defined as: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Level 1: fopen - chdir</LI>

<LI>Level 2: connect - accept</LI>

<LI>Level 3: malloc - mfree</LI>

<LI>Level 4: exec - getpid</LI>

<LI>Level 5: semget - receive</LI>
</UL>

<P>If the file needs a Possible Level greater than the level provided by
the library, an &quot;E_LIBLEVEL&quot; error code should be returned by
forkto or exec. 
<HR>For example, a program that needs the file functions, and can optionally
(i.e. if available) use the exec and fork calls, should have &quot;1&quot;
as a Needed Function, and level 4 as Possible Functions. </P>
