<p>
In 1989, I first thought about building a self-designed computer.  I 
already had some experience with 6502 based computers. A friend of mine 
and I had been trying to build a telephone line switch computer based on 
the 6502. Although the project never succeeded (well, to a certain extent 
it worked, but then we always got new ideas...), the project gave me an 
idea of what an OS should be capable of.
</p><p>
With my homebrew computer, I not only wanted to implement one of those 
'simple' OSes as in the C64 or other 6502 based computer, but I also 
wanted to go a step further and do a real multitasking, microkernel 
design OS. This constrained the hardware design to allow memory mapping 
of key memory locations, including the 6502 zero-page and stack.
</p>
    </div></div><div class="h2"><div class="h2h"><div class="h2t">&nbsp;</div><h2><a name="realos">What Should a Real OS Do?</a></h2></div><div class="h2c"><p>
A real operating system has four major parts that handle the 
input/output, filesystems, memory management and process handling.  At 
the very least, a "real" OS includes some form of multitasking :-)
</p>
    <h3><a name="procs">Process Management</a></h3>
<p>
Process management forms one block of an OS. A multitasking operating 
system requires more administration than a single-tasking OS. A process, 
or task, can be seen as a set of allocated resources.  These resources 
include memory pages, swap pages, open files, and even the CPU, if the 
task is active. The CPU is the processing element that executes the given 
program using the allocated resources. Therefore, the CPU state has to be 
saved if a task is interrupted. This  allows undisturbed continuation 
after the interruption is handled. For each task, the allocated resources 
have to be registered and freed. As the CPU can be allocated to only a 
single task at a given time, it must be shared among all the active 
processes.  So, in order to create the illusion of executing multiple 
processes at the same time (pseudo-parallelism), the CPU has to be 
assigned to one task after another, at a speed that achieves this 
illusion.  If the assignments happen too slow, the illusion is lost, but 
if the speed is too fast, the CPU spends all of its time administering 
the tasks and not enough time executing the tasks.  The same concepts 
hold true for multiprocessor  computers, except that such a machine can 
achieve parallel operation on as many tasks as there are CPUs in the 
system.
</p><p>
A scheduler interrupts the CPU after a certain time to allow the CPU to 
be assigned to another task. If the scheduler interrupts the task itself 
to schedule a new task, the system is called preemptive. If the task has 
to give the CPU back to the system, it is called cooperative 
multitasking, like in MS Windows (tm).  of the two, preemptive is 
preferred, as cooperative multitasking fails when a single process 
forgets or is unable to relinquish control of the CPU.  If such a 
scenario occurs, the computer is "blocked".
</p>
<h3><a name="io">I/O</a></h3>
<p>
As the second part, I/O provides a uniform interface to all peripherals, 
including character devices (serial lines, parallel printers), or block 
devices (disk drives). These services are normally provided by device 
drivers, which, in some operating systems, are even loadable. One problem 
is the communication between device interrupt routines and the rest of 
the system. Andrew Tanenbaum, in _Operating Systems, Design and 
Implementation_, says that, "Interrupts are an unpleasant fact of life. 
They should be hidden away, deep in the bowels of the system, so that as 
little of the system as possible knows about them." Nevertheless, 
interrupts are necessary to handle time critical operations, like 
providing new data to serial lines. Provisions must be taken to avoid 
data corruption by an interrupt routine and a program (or the kernel) 
using the same memory locations at the same time. So, even if you don't 
like interrupts, you have to use them.
</p>
<h3><a name="fs">Filesystem</a></h3>
<p>
As the third part, the filesystem provides user-level abstraction of I/O. 
Files store information of any kind. It is the most visible part of the 
OS. The naming conventions make a big part of the OS view for the normal 
user. (Remember the 8+3 character filename length restriction in MS-DOS 
filesystems?) The filesystem itself provides a standard interface to the 
user, although the underlying structure (i.e. how files are stored) may 
differ on different devices. In UNIX operating systems, even devices can 
be used as files and are represented by special entries in the directory 
structure (on the newest version of Linux (pre2.0.) even files can be 
used as filesystem (that hold files that can be used as filesystem (that 
hold files.. Ooops ;-))). I will not go further into this issue, but how 
a filesystem is organized can sometimes become a religious war among 
their respective followers. Since a filesystem keeps all internal 
structures to itself, it is possible to mount differently structured 
filesystems in one system.
</p>
<h3><a name="mmu">Memory Management</a></h3>
<p>
As the final part, memory management keeps track of which parts of the 
memory are in use and which are not. Memory can be allocated when needed 
and is freed for other uses when no longer needed. Modern systems use the 
concept of virtual memory. Virtual memory specifies a system that uses a 
translation table between the CPU and the real memory locations.  When 
the CPU tries to access a certain memory address, the address given in 
the opcode does not reflect the real address used to access the memory 
chips.  Instead, the translation table is used to look up the real memory 
address from the `virtual' address given in the opcode. So, if there is 
no appropriately sized contiguous memory block available in real memory, 
such a block can be built using smaller chunks by setting up the 
translation table for the task. The lookup is done by the memory 
management unit (MMU). Software called a memory mapper is used to load 
and change the table. It loads the table with the values set up for each 
task.  So the same opcode address in two different tasks accesses very 
different memory locations in the RAM.
</p><p>
More sophisticated memory managers even do swapping. The memory manager 
allows a task to allocate more memory than actually available. If a 
memory location that is not available is accessed, the CPU is trapped 
(the ability to do this cleanly was one of the (IMHO very few) additions 
from the Motorola 68000 to the 68010 CPU). The memory manager then saves 
(swaps out) another memory page to disk and uses the now free memory. The 
CPU can then continue. If a swapped out memory address is accessed, the 
CPU is halted again and the page is swapped in again - swapping out 
another page if necessary. Clearly this slows the whole thing down, but 
then virtual addresses are a very nice feature. You can hide the pages 
used by other tasks or map the same memory to several tasks, making it 
shared memory.
</p>
<h3><a name="cbm">In the CBMs...</a></h3>
<p>
These inclusion of these features implies that all resources can be 
assigned equally to each task. As there are problems with this in the 
6502 (think of the stack), another concept should at least be mentioned. 
The IBM `Virtual Machine' (VM/*) series of operating systems emulates the 
entire computer's hardware resources for a single task (i.e. a task 
doesn't talk to the system via system calls, but by writing data into 
some I/O registers).  These register accesses are trapped and appropriate 
action is taken. This means that the task can behave as if it owns the 
entire machine.  This also means it must load its own OS to handle disk 
and other I/O (the second part of the "VM/*" naming scheme).
</p><p>

The Commodore PET and its successors, the VIC, C64 and 128, already 
contain some functionality of a "real" OS.  On these machines, a single 
interface allows uniform file access across different devices (tape, 
disk, console). All of them are accessed via the standard OPEN / CKOUT / 
CHKIN / CLOSE system calls. However, I/O comprises only one part of an 
OS, as defined above.  The Commodore 8 bit computers are single CPU, 
singletasking systems (for exceptions see below). Therefore, no process 
management is necessary. In addition, there is no memory management. All 
memory is assigned to the single running process. (Although sometimes the 
need for multiple $cXXX pages seems pressing.)  The filesystem, an 
important part of an OS, is put into the floppy drive on Commodore 8-bit 
computers and is accessed via standard I/O over the IEEE bus.
</p><p>

One interesting exception is the old (IEEE488) Commodore disk drives. 
These drives have not one but two processors: one 6502 and a 6504 that 
run in parallel and share some memory. The 6504 is used as a floppy drive 
controller that handles the low level disk I/O. The 6502 gets the 
commands from the bus and processes the `filesystem' task. By writing low 
level commands to certain memory locations, it sends commands to the 
floppy drive controller (the 6504) that in turn reads and writes the disk 
blocks. If you look at the 1541, for example, you can see that this 
concept still holds true. However, in the 1541, the interrupt routine 
takes the role of the drive controller. Ironically, this reduction in 
CPUs was done to save 1541.  In its effort to cut costs, Commodore forced 
the single CPU of the 1541 to multitask, creating a bare operating system 
to support drive operation.
</p>
    </div></div><div class="h2"><div class="h2h"><div class="h2t">&nbsp;</div><h2><a name="design">Modern Kernel Design</a></h2></div><div class="h2c"><p>
Early operating systems started with a monolithic approach. i.e. all the 
system functions were provided with one big binary. Modern UNIX systems- 
even Linux, which is not derived from the original UNIX source- use this 
concept.
</p><p>
A modern kernel instead has a microkernel design. A microkernel only 
provides the means of communication between different processes, not 
doing much itself. Some implementations even have the scheduler (!) or 
memory manager (!) running as a separate task. The kernel calls these 
processes to find out about free memory pages and which task to start 
next. This reduces the size of the kernel and allows greater flexibility.  
On the downside, the microkernel designs forces more messages to be 
transferred, slowing down operation somewhat.
</p><p>
One `famous' microkernel implementation is the current Mach microkernel. 
This kernel, and its derivatives, has been ported to many platforms. The 
PowerPC Platform OS/2 is based on a mach derived microkernel, as well as 
Linux for PowerPC Macintosh (mklinux). But, these are relatively simple
ports of already existing operating systems. These mach `single servers'
don't allow alternate OS system to run alongside or instead of themselves.
On the other hand, the GNU Hurd operating system exploits the mach design
to allow any server to be replaced by another.
</p>
    </div></div><div class="h2"><div class="h2h"><div class="h2t">&nbsp;</div><h2><a name="osa">The OS/A65 Operating System</a></h2></div><div class="h2c"><p>
Now let's get from theory to practice...
</p>
    <h3><a name="kernel">The Kernel Implementation</a></h3><p>
When it comes to hardware design, the 6502 has a big advantage: It is a 
very simple CPU. With only a few support ICs, it is possible to build a 
fully functional computer (neglecting video and sound capabilities). On 
the other hand, the simplicity of the CPU has drawbacks. The 6502 has 
only three multi-purpose registers, and all are 8 bits.  As such, none 
can hold a complete 16 bit 6502 memory location. Even the stack pointer 
is 8 bits, restricting the stack to the 256 bytes from $0100 to $01ff. 
The stack size and the absolute addresses are a severe limitation if you 
intend to develop a multitasking OS on this machine.
</p><p>
Because I was developing a new system, I could do anything I wanted to 
get around this problem. I solved the stack problem by using an MMU, a 
Memory Management Unit. (Although the used chip, the 74ls610 is stated to 
be a `Memory Mapper' for paged memory mapping, I call it a `Memory 
Management Unit'...). The upper 4 address bits are used to select one of 
16 8-bit registers. (The 74ls610 has 12-bit registers, but only 8 bits 
are used, for obvious reasons.) The output of the registers were then 
used as the upper 8 address bits, extending the total accessible memory 
to 1 MByte. The CPU could switch each 4 kByte page to any of the 256 
pages available by changing the register values in the MMU. Oops - just 
introduced virtual addresses to the 6502 ;-)
</p><p>

For each task, new memory is allocated and saved in the task's page 
table. When a task is activated, the MMU registers are loaded with these 
values, giving each task its own memory environment. In the described OS, 
the memory `manager' is part of the kernel, although a quite independent 
part. The virtual addresses in the opcodes are translated to the real 
addresses through the contents of the MMU registers.
</p><p>

The tasks are handled by the environment routines. These routines set up 
the environment tables used by the scheduler. The (round robin) scheduler 
performs the task switching and decides which task to run next. 
Preemptive multitasking is achieved by using the interrupt to switch 
between different tasks. The most important routines are the two kernel 
entry and exit routines. These sub-routines have to switch the pages and 
the stack pointer as well as preserve all other register values. 
</p><p>

The tasks providing filesystem services register with the filesystem 
manager. They are then assigned drive numbers.  Although UNIX filesystems 
are virtual, where a user can reconfigure the system at any time, 
developing such a system for the 6502 would overly complicate matters.  
Different filesystems can then be used at the same time with different 
drive numbers. The drive numbers are translated by the filesystem manager 
when passing the message through to the filesystem task.  Currently 
`fsiec' for IEEE488 (parallel IEC-bus) interfaced CBM disk drives, 
`fsibm' (for PC style disks) and `fsdev' for using devices as files are 
provided.
</p><p>

The interface to the hardware is provided by the devices. Devices are 
simply stripped off tasks and are called as subroutines only.  A device-
filesystem (`fsdev') task translates filesystem requests to the device 
interface, so that any device can be used like a file.  The general 
structure can be seen in Fig.1.

<p>
Fig.1: General OS structure. The devices and tasks make up the features 
of the system, while the kernel provides communications. 
(fsm = filesystem manager, env = environment handling, task switcher)
</p><p>
In addition to executing code within the task, tasks also need to 
execute to communicate with other tasks or components of the OS. To 
communicate between tasks, a send/receive interface is provided. Using a 
rendezvous technique (the sender blocks till the message can directly be 
copied to the receiver and vice versa) the mechanism is kept simple, as 
no buffering is involved. Semaphores can be used for synchronization 
between different tasks. Data streams are used to pass data between 
tasks, and even between tasks and devices. Each task has a standard 
input, output, and error streams opened upon creation, analogous to the 
stream in UNIX systems. The shell can even redirect or pipe the output.
</p>
    <h3><a name="examples">Program examples</a></h3><p>
The shell is a good example to show some of the capabilities of the 
system. As already mentioned, each task has three specially assigned 
streams. Filesystem tasks don't use them (and have them set to an ignored 
stream), but shells normally get started with these streams
connected to a terminal device or a serial line device. The streams are 
normally opened by the task that `forks' the new task. On boot, the ROM 
contains some hints about which device number to open for a program. When 
a new task is started with a shell command, the shell has to open the 
devices.  Normally the standard input and output streams used by the 
shell itself are registered for the new task. However, if given on the 
command line, other files can be opened and the streams for these files 
used as stdio streams.
</p><p>
When a file has to be opened, an OPEN message is sent to the filesystem 
manager. This part of the kernel translates the drive number and forwards 
the message to the filesystem task. The filesystem then tries to open the 
file and sends a reply message. The originating task
provides a stream number with its first message. If the filesystem task 
succeeds in opening the file, it uses the provided stream to read or 
write the data to. If the file ends, the writing task closes the stream, 
which is recognized by the other end when there's nothing more to read.  
This works for read only and write only opens, but not for read/write 
opens.
</p>
    <h3><a name="problems">Problems</a></h3><p>
Bootstrapping was the first major problem. How do you start a new 
computer and debug its OS if don't have an OS on the computer?  From 
earlier systems I already had a small monitor program - directly burned 
into an EPROM - able to load binaries through a serial line. Getting the 
MMU (74ls610) was the second problem, because it was on the CoCom list, 
and it was not allowed to export to eastern countries. (Although I don't 
live in an eastern country, this posed some difficulties...)
</p><p>
After defining the necessary interfaces between kernel and tasks and 
kernel and devices, the design was quite straightforward, actually. One 
problem was the small number of registers in the 6502. For some of the 
kernel routines, as well as for the send/receive interface it was 
necessary to define a special buffer. This buffer is at an absolute
address at $02XX, which is the same for each task. For systems with an 
MMU, this is not a problem after all. But it showed out to be a 
significant problem when porting the OS to systems without MMU, like the 
C64 (see below).
</p>
    </div></div><div class="h2"><div class="h2h"><div class="h2t">&nbsp;</div><h2><a name="nommu">Operating without an MMU</a></h2></div><div class="h2c"><p>
After the system worked well with an MMU, I decided to build a stripped 
down version for systems without an MMU to better fit some `embedded 
applications' I had in mind. The system without an MMU is much more a 
multithreading than a multitasking system. Threads, as opposed to tasks, 
share the same memory, thus being able to change variables and data of 
other threads. But, on the other hand, two identical programs cannot run 
at the same time as with an MMU, unless they know they will together 
ahead of time.
</p><p>
The problem lies within the limited stack size of the 6502. Without an 
MMU, it is not possible to remap memory pages, especially the page with 
the stack in it. So the stack is divided into several parts, limiting the 
stack size of each thread, of course. Another problem is global, absolute 
addresses - like the send/receive buffer for example. As it would be too 
much of a rewrite and memory wastage to give each thread its own buffer, 
the send/receive buffer is now protected by a semaphore. A sempahore is a 
construct that allows exactly one thread to be in a certain routine or 
manipulate the protected data at a time. Semaphores originate from the 
railways, where it is important not to have two trains on the same rail, 
running in opposite directions...
</p>
    </div></div><div class="h2"><div class="h2h"><div class="h2t">&nbsp;</div><h2><a name="c64">Port to the C64</a></h2></div><div class="h2c"><p>
In addition to lacking an MMU, the Commodore 64 posed other porting 
problems. Only small changes had to be made to the kernel.  The C64 
kernel required an interrupt source for task switching. The video device 
had to be changed to support the C64 keyboard map and video interface. 
The hardware cursor used in my homebrew computer was replaced by a 
software cursor. The IEEE488 filesystem was first ported to the IEEE488 
interface for the C64 and then to the C64 serial port. When stress 
testing the system I realized that I still hadn't ported the STDIO 
library - a few low level subroutines that make life easier. The library 
was mapped to most tasks and was called from the task environment, not 
from inside the kernel. Unfortunately, it used global variables - which 
broke the library when running on a multithreaded system without an MMU. 
Therefore, some routines have been changed, while others can only be 
protected by a semaphore.

Well, the C128 has more memory and even the capability of remapping the 
stack and zero page to other locations. In a simple expansion of the C64 
version, this could be a way to raise the limited stack size to the full 
possible 256 bytes. Then, other ideas come to mind. The original memory 
management is made for a system with MMU and is quite useless without an 
MMU. What is missing is a call to get a contiguous memory block of more 
than a memory page in size. Then such a large block could be allocated 
for a new task to load the binary. The binary itself must then be 
relocated to fit the new address range. Unfortunately, plans to extend 
the system calls or add relocation capabilities do not exist at this 
time.

The OS/A65 operating system provides multitasking and multithreading 
capabilities with a modern kernel design for a 6502 CPU. The OS can be 
used from embedded applications to desktop systems. A shell provides 
modern I/O redirection and piping capabilities. Filesystems for Commodore 
disk drives and PC-style floppies are available. For me, it was a real 
adventure to design a completely new computer and operating system the 
way I wanted them designed. I also learned a lot about operating system 
design - maybe you have learned a bit as well. If you are interested in 
it, more information is available at
